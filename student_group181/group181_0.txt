<resp>None</resp><review>Booked last minute rentals here over Memorial day weekend. Boy were we unprepared but luckily Gavin was patient enough to fit our rentals, helped us install a bike rack and even gave detailed directions to the trail we wanted to check out. The bikes were super fun to ride once we made it out! He made a point to ask us how our day went after returning the bikes and even provided suggestions for future trips. I'm so impressed with how friendly everyone here was. There are plenty of bike shops in the area to choose from so great staff makes all the difference. Will definitely use them again and recommend to anyone visiting the area.< /review></record>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>When I went into Epicenter Cycling, I was looking for a hard-tail mountain bike but ended up with a full-suspension model (FUEL EX 5 Deore) that is absolutely the most fun, most capable bicycle that I have ever owned. The salesperson, Zack, was friendly and helpful, and while he showed me the original type of bicycle that I had in mind, he also encouraged me to try out a full-suspension model because he thought that it would suit me better.

You could say that this is pretty standard upselling, but the point is that Zack was right. After riding both bikes, I could see clear advantages to the full-suspension model. I bought it and took it out that day to Wilder Creek Ranch and rode along the bumpy, beautiful cliff trails and had a wonderful ride. My old hybrid, no-suspension bike is ok on those trails, but it is slower and more challenging to maneuver among the bumps and ruts.

So, after listening to me talk about the sort of riding that I've done and that I want to do, Zack directed me toward a bicycle that's a perfect fit. The suspension set-up makes the trails so much more manageable and the dropper post is a thing of beauty. Who knew? The quality of my riding experience improved immensely.

The staff at Epicenter Cycling knows their products well and Trek bicycles are great. I especially appreciate the lifetime tune-ups and fit adjustments that come with my new bike purchase. I don't buy new bicycles often, and I wanted to buy one that I would get years of enjoyment from, which I know that I have.

I'd definitely recommend anyone in the market for a new bicycle to visit Epicenter Cycling.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Amazing selection of Trek bikes! We were told it would be 2022 before we'd be able to get to bikes by everyone within 3hours drive, so we drove 3 hours to Santa Cruz and we're now able to enjoy them for the entire warm season. They know their stuff and have amazing customer service! Zach was amazing to work with and spent lots of time despite being swamped.  I saw a couple people leave instated of waiting to get in; what a dumb move! You'll be glad for the wait when you get inside and see the selection.<//Text></record>

<Text>All of the employees were so friendly and helpful.  I worked with Mark and he helped me find the perfect bike for me.  He was very patient with my questions and listened to my feedback about the several bikes I test rode.  I never felt pressured and I'm really happy with my purchase.  I had been looking at bikes online, but the reason I chose Epicenter is because of the lifetime care arrangement that comes with the bike.  I love that tune ups and check ins are included with the purchase of the bike.  I'm so happy I went to Epicenter instead of buying a bike online!< /Text><GmapID>0x808e6a7f6b666d4f:0xfd9214abe1df3a4d</GmapID><date>1612288803586</date><user_id>108792737827746934756< /user_id><Response>{'time': 1614824613439, 'text': "Thank you so much for taking the time to leave this wonderful review, Tiffany.

<Review>At Epicenter, I found friendly staff who were knowledgeable of their products (of which the products were high quality and in great selection). Mark helped me find everything I needed and went above and beyond throughout the experience. Additionally, he made it very easy for me to ask some beginner level questions I've been scared to ask. His answers were both informative and encouraging. Lastly, the staff treated me more like a fellow rider than a customer, making it clear that they truly are just fellow riders who happen to stand on the other side of the register when all is said and done.</Review><Time>1610335976198<//Time><Response>{'time': 1614824330910, 'text': 'Thank you Kyle for taking the time to leave this thoughtful review.

Rented a bike here.  I dig the process.  Transaction was done outside.  Showed me the bike and the controls and off I go.

Why 3 stars?  The staff didn't want me to go inside the store.  Not sure why, maybe I should have asked, but dang man.  Why you got treat me like a 2nd rate customer?  Did you think I was going to steal something after I just spent money on renting a bike?

I was expecting some type of feedback when I returned the bike like, how did you like the bike?  Or would you like to see our inventory.  Nah, they just took the bike made me wait outside and told me, I'm good.

You know if you let me in while I waited, I would have bought something like the Rail 5 or Rail 7 you had in stock at your store. Which I checked online on the Trek website.  You  could have made even more money if you just let me in.  I was planning on buying the bike they had in stock after test riding, but they got there money from the rental.  I don't even know if they would use that as a credit towards a new bike like what most shops would do after renting/demoing a bike but yeah oh well.

FYI this was the first visit to this store location that I never step my foot inside to.   Just disappointed that I didn't have the privilege to buy anything at your store.</text>

<username>Tera C< /username><date>1615593185281</date><rating>5</rating><Review>I just purchased a Trek Verve 3+ Lowstep I was considering other eBikes in the Trek family. After watching a few videos that Epicenter made I felt great about making a decision. The videos are very informative and no sales pitch whatsoever. The bike is AMAZING!!!! Mark is also amazing. On the phone, he walked me through some beta that i needed to know, listened to the seat type, tools, panniers, etc that I wanted. I came in the next day and Mark had the bike completely set up. They measured my seat height and showed me around the bike.. It was easy and they didn't embellish or try to sell me something I didn't want. These people at Mission know their stuff and are 110% reliable. I would say that if folks go anywhere else to buy a bike they're making a sad mistake. A Very Satisfied Customer<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Phil who serviced my bike did an above average job. Even after I brought it back he said he wanted me to be satisfied and to bring it back again if I needed to. He was making sure his job was completed and done well. I brought it back again and Jose interrupted his current job on another bike to check the continuing problem since Phil was off from work that day. He carefully inspected and corrected the problem. I've had good service from other bike shops but this has to be the very best I ever received. I now am convinced Epicenter Cycling is the most trustworthy shop in the county and maybe than even other shops in nearby counties. The mechanics went out of their way to be more than great mechanics. They earned my respect and confidence. I can see why this shop is the highest rated than all the others I viewed. I live closer to other good bike shops in the county but I wouldn't hesitate bringing my bikes here for service. I now recommend this shop much more than the one near the Boardwalk which I previously thought was good. Like a car mechanic you have to be careful since its not easy knowing who will not only do a great job but also if they're honest and have integrity. This shop is it<//Review>

I was able to make my purchase over the phone thanks to very helpful and knowledgeable staff. They answered my questions and helped me pick the right bike. I am a big proponent of shopping locally. Despite being a small business, their service and inventory is world-class. Without a doubt, I will be coming back in the future for future bike purchases.< /review>

<text>Rented a Trek Fuel EX 8 29 which was cool because I have the same bike.  The staff was awesome.  Super friendly and told me how to get to the good spots!

Price wasn't the highest in town either.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6ACkOCIKdIUL_o0uN_P-Bd7tgnQ8LIikuFy4B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn88ySWhZUt8IUTp89G4qWutQDfIoy2ERbnCvO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLNkRqGwqTwfjjABCrxnWeGxwqiuVot1V88Ksk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMeVO_slqaM3LoerSSOSlkmswyGZ_8yoA8LOtu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgqLwqtlBjTuEOodzWE38n366I-WgihN3nvLNy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqip00DBnIpVygC48U_hJ8JZfpq-fXCvvb8vUT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMITpjbui3oNOjBjenaBoI6FPvqUjbXS3zStDz2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKL1HC1AofaW1Z7pXr45yB0ordaZtT5yhI9VDj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEDql9iZb4XUiW1C4THaDNU4_aDTPkkDgYN5rr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMM0hWLFj02bCpbe3YGE9crKb_jq1Q3woyY2BN4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ2xdP2duxV-u2v_SVDNRxWQz5Bfsz_0HK86Ef=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4oxq-2oG0-hyC20D-2W3eAjFNt0NcwklILIbf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYNjdU5M0zTrH2gRDJ3LLKg6l6Va3kUuHmB_i6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRJLVKc5BlOoZ6rGAKE4IC3jK5sN4TmwGlKPZy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>{'time': 1518729306369, 'text': "We're so stoked you had a great time, Jon!

<text>I called in advance to order and pay for my new bike, plus some accessories. Zach was extremely helpful and took the time to answer all my questions thoroughly and in detail, so I felt I was getting what I was looking for and within my price range. He also assisted me in purchasing a helmet, again letting me know his recommendations and expressing his expertise knowledge of the products they sell. He was also very patient and courteous, as I was looking for specific colors and he even assisted me over the phone on how to see what he was describing on the online website. Service was just as awesome when I went in to pickup my new bike and even got me a bell and some night lights too!</text><response>{'time': 1594861081233, 'text': "Thank you Christiana for taking the time to leave this thoughtful, detailed review.

I just wanted to take the time and share that we were treated wonderfully. My son and I both felt like we were really listened to and our sales person spent a huge amount of time with us. We ended up finding a perfect bike that was in my budget and that was exactly what my son wanted. I feel like we made the perfect choice both for bike and bike shop.
Also wanted to give a huge compliment to our wonderfully patient and incredibly knowledgeable sales person Shawn Wilson. He really listened to what my son wanted and never once spoke down to him or made him feel like a newbie. He spent at least an hour going over maintenance and showing him how things worked as well as letting him ride different bikes. He was able to assist us with financing and I am overjoyed with the options and it was all so easy. We are also really impressed with the  bike company Trek as well; both with their products and their Customer Service.
Thanks again Epicenter Cycling,  Shawn Wilson & Trek!

Before I start, please know that I do not leave negative review but I had to due the the very poor customer service we received today. Please keep in mind that we were very professional, we didnt yell and we were not loud over the phone.

We drove over 2 hrs to get here this morning at approx 11am to pick up our bike after putting half down deposit over the phone yesterday early afternoon. We were told yesterday that they would pull the bike out and get it assembled and it will be ready for us to pick up when we arrive today. When we arrived, the bike was still unboxed. We were told they needed 45 minutes to assemble. An hour and a half later, we called in to check status. A lady who claims she was the owner told us that they were repairing the bike for us..?! We told her the store shouldn't be making repairs on a new bike they haven't delivered to us. We explained to her that we were promised the bike would be done yesterday but had not been unboxed this morning, she was not trying to hear us but proceeded to tell us that it is normal that they run into issues while putting the bike together. The fact that she told us they were "REPAIRING THE BIKE FOR US" was absurd because the bike is suppose to be brand new and we hadn't picked up the bike yet, not to mention they weren't doing us any favor by repairing a brand new bike. She eventually understood that they did drop the ball and didn't get the bike done the day before like promised and was apologetic but at that time, we were way too frustrated, especially after she was possibly unaware that she addressed my husband by "BRO" What the heck kind of customer service is this? My husband is black so he was appalled at the fact that he was addressed anything other than "Sir" as if our money wasn't good there. Our deposit was credited back to us per our request. This was a very disappointing birthday and trip experience as we took the time to read the store review and drove over 2 hrs to the store to get my husband a bike and it didn't happen.<//text>

Best place to rent Ebike for sure. Always have few of them available. Fully charged. 10 min from you walking in to drive out. Bikes in a very good condition and have much very big range. Much bigger then most of the riders themself :) that l you guys for incredible journey! Best $80 I've ever spend!< /review>

Dropped off two bikes worth $8,000. New cassette and dropper post repairs needed. I was told the bikes were ready. They were not ready. Cassettes were not replaced, and they had damaged the dropper posts. When I asked the owner (Sean) what had happened, he said 'things are busy now' and offered no compensation. 2 weeks wasted and additional damage done to my bike, thanks Epicenter. Don't waste your time and money with these jokers.< /text>

<Date>1590539389099< /Date><Review>I am new to the world of Mountain biking. I went to Epicenter Santa Cruz last week to get an old hand me down bike assessed for a fixed up.  I was helped by a man named Curtis. I wound up buying a new bike because the old one was too far gone but I didn't feel pressured at all. He was very kind and answered my questions knowledgeably. He helped me pick a good helmet too, even made sure I liked the color (so nice). Everyone was very friendly and helpful which was such a nice surprise because I have been to other bike shops in the area where the employees were very uppity. I referred a friend there about a week later. When my friend mentioned my name someone I had only spoken to on the phone once remembered me by name among all the customers that come through their doors each day. I am really glad I found this place!</Review>< Resp>

<Review>This is the fourth Trek bike I have purchased. Purchased My wife a bike for Mother’s Day and she loves it. Due to COVID we had to wait outside but we understand and didn’t mind the wait. Once we finally got some assistance, we were helped right away and advised on what would be the best bike for my wife. We ended up getting her Trek Dual Sport 2 and took it the next day for a great ride in Monterey. I ended up getting another Marlin but this time I got the 2020 Marlin 7. I love the frame color and upgrades vs the Marlin 5 I already own. Overall it was a great experience, great service and prices. Would highly recommend this place to anyone.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>I've been in this shop a few times only because it is on the Westside and I am in the Seabright, but my bike is a Trek and when I need specially tailored help or parts I go to Epicenter.  On this trip, I needed tubes and I headed over because of their policy regarding social distancing and shopping. The employees were friendly and helpful. The one guy who sold me my tubes was very informative about some potential routes I could ride and I really appreciated his help and enthusiasm. That made the whole experience less stressful. Great LBS!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>I went in for a routine tune-up, as well as for a few replacement parts for my bike. The customer service was excellent, and I was recommended low-cost parts with no pressure to purchase higher-valued items. My bike was ready in about 24 hours -- definitely would come again!</text><Time>1584402466034< /Time>< gmapID>

Great selection of bikes for any kind of riding you desire and a great customer service team. Bought my first FS bike here and was helped through the whole transaction by Curtis with tips and tricks of the functions of my new bike. Definitely recommend Epicenter Cycling to anybody looking to buy a new bike or to come in for a service. Thank you!< /review>

Amazing service. Always attentive to my needs and quick to help. Friendly and knowledgeable. Shawn is great and is always looking to expand the capabilities of his stores. He recently employed two veterans of Fox Suspension’s service department to start an amazing Suspension service department. They serviced my shock the same day which would take weeks to do through Fox and very expensive. What an amazing service to have available here in Santa Cruz! Also an amazing EBike selection and the full lineup from Trek Bikes. Love my Slash and loved my Fuel EX before that. I’ll never buy a bike from anyone else! Thanks!<//text>

Eric was great during a Covid-distancing Sunday morning. We found exactly what we were looking for and took his advice on a number of items. We look forward to shopping there again.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>On Friday the 10th of July (2020) I found myself looking for a new bike to replace this old generic mountain bike I got years ago. I made up my mind to hit up three different shops that I had researched about. Didn't really have a brand nor specifics on what I was looking for. I started at Epicenter Cycling and I was met at the door by Zack. He asked how he could help me. I explained to him what I was looking for and what my price point was and told him I was new to the sport of cycling but wanted to get into it. He was super helpful and also respectful of my new interest in bikes. He didn't make me feel like a dummy for not knowing much and that made me feel confident to ask more questions. The whole process didn't take long and soon enough we narrowed down my search to The Demone AL 2 Treck bike. He professionally measured me on a 52 and I was able to ride it around the block. After I returned from my test run we figured out a 54 would be best. He showed me on the computer what options were available, color scheme, and other bikes to compare. I ended up picking the black and gold option and had a work order to put the bike together. Once we had everything in order to pay Zack went over everything one last time to make sure I was satisfied with what I was getting and really I couldn't have been anymore happier with the customer service I was provided. He made me feel inspired to really involve myself in this new lifestyle of bike riding that I wanted to get into. At the end of the transaction we had this running joke about how I looked like this dude named Hector and my explanation was because my Dad used to party a lot I must have siblings around I don't know about!!! That cracked me up hard! To put it simply this place was everything I wanted in a bike shop and with everything available and the staff being so helpful I did not need to even bother going to another shop and wasting my time. Thank you so much for everything you guys and I look forward to coming back soon and also recommending this shop to my buddies and everyone I talk to! You guys rock! Peace and stay safe!!</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Every single time I visit Santa Cruz, I have asked for a helping hand storing our expensive carbon bikes while we go about town for our last day of each visit. Since we are checked out of the hotel by noon on our final day each visit, this location always accommodates this request, and we always make sure to purchase something from the shop. The staff is professional, friendly, and always lends us a helping hand to cyclists in need.<//Text>

<Text>I just had great service buying an ebike at Epicenter. Plenty of detailed info about the bike, great test ride after a fitting, easy purchase and setup of the bike. And when I left the charger at the shop, Chris came by to drop if off on his way home so I could have the first commute ride tomorrow morning. Excellent experience.</Text>< date>

I feel like Epicenter has my back. I had a problem with my kickstand, ordered a new one and tried to install it at home ... and couldn't get the whole thing put back together! I took it into the shop and they had my bike back in working condition with a new kickstand only half an hour later.

I needed a new wheel and they got that in and replaced it quickly; they called me as soon as it was ready. When I picked it up, the bike felt tighter and easier to ride and the squeaks were gone.

I bought my bike from Epicenter a few years ago and they've kept it tuned and maintained ever since. Their lifetime tuneups are awesome. Epicenter definitely helps you keep your bike in shape long after the sale, and that's worth it on its own.<//text>< Pictures>

Epicenter is awesome!!! Only minutes from closing, my daughter needed a new bike as her previous one died completely on us. Not only did they take the time to make sure that she got the right bike, but the techs stayed late just to put it together for her to make sure she was able to ride to school on her new, early birthday gift! Smiles all around and a very happy customer!<//Text>

I bought a bike in Santa Cruz and needed it packaged for shipping. Epicenter packed it up and did a GREAT job. I was thrilled. They did the best packaging job I have ever seen and the bike arrived in perfect condition. It needed to be shipped to South Orange County, CA but could have gone anywhere in the world as it was packed so well. Highly recommended.</Review>

Great shop. I just purchased my first carbon road bike from these guys and my experience was great. The owner, Shawn, spent a very substantial amount of time helping me figure out what products suit my needs best and was very patient with my questions. The customer service was so good in fact that I didn't even realize that Shawn was the owner until after I bought my bike; very approachable and down to earth. The itself shop is very professional, definitely felt like I was in good hands. Overall a great experience and great deal, check them out before you buy your next bike.<//review>

This place is amazing I can't say enough good things about it. The staff is friendly, the owner himself is there and willing to help you find what you need or are looking for and if he don't have it, he is willing to order it for you. Their selection is fantastic. The store is neat and tidy. They also do repairs and general maintenance for your bikes. If you have not been there I highly recommend you check it out.</review>

What a great shop! I looked all over town to purchase a full suspension bike from someone's demo fleet and Shawn came through in a big way. He brought a bike that he thought would work for me from the Aptos store over to Mission Street, fitted me on the bike, and sent me off with it for a demo ride. The bike worked great, but the part I really appreciated was his willingness to work with me on addressing the few tweaks I needed for the bike to really work for me, and most importantly his willingness to work with me to do something within my budget. Thanks for the excellent service!!!</text>

Excellent, Very impressed.  Shawn, the owner, and all his staff do an outstanding job.  I ride a bike everyday, have many bikes, frequent other shops and do all my own mechanical work - this is a great place.  Recently bought a bike on Ebay and needed a Trek part that only Epicenter had, they treated me great when I told them and respect them for that. They also gave me another part for free :-)<//Text>

<review>I first found out about this shop looking up rentals in Santa Cruz that I used for a half Ironman. I ended up buying a bike that was shipped to me out of state. There was an issue with a part. Everyone at the shop was professional in helping me get the new part shipped from Shimano out to my local shop to get fixed. That is pretty awesome. I’m hoping to be out riding very soon but wanted to take time to leave a review because I felt like everyone in the shop was really helpful in sorting out a problem and hooking me up with a sweet bike!< /review><name>Missy Walker</name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We bought two bikes (Domane 5.2 & 4.7) after renting them. The experience was very good throughout - professional, knowledgeable, courteous and friendly. Particular shout out to Andrea - he really knows his stuff; Candace for her warm, friendly and artistic flair, and Hank for his advice.

I have recommended this shop to others and will do so in the future.<//Review>< Pictures>

Sean was friendly & welcoming as I walked into the store. I was returning a Blix Sol Cruiser Electric bicycle and looking for a more commuter friendly bicycle for me, a retired 69 year old senior. I test rode the Blix Aveny step through but it wasn’t a good fit. Keep in mind, I’m not a hardcore cyclist & I just wanted something comfortable to ride around town & on bike trails. Sean suggested some other electric bicycle options & I test rode the Electra Townie. It was perfect, Sean explained how to use all the functions & the proper maintenance items I should handle from home. I bought a few accessories because of Sean’s great knowledge about bicycles, and the great customer service he provided. I don’t mind spending money when a customer is treated with respect and made to feel that their bicycle needs are important.< /Text>

This shop feels like family; I fell in love with cycling a few years ago and this shop has been by my side ever since. I recently bought my newest road bike here and I'm grateful to have a shop that I trust. Thanks guys!< /review>

Bummer. I don't like giving bad reviews but $25 to change a tube and getting bad attitude in the service center has me going somewhere else. For good. Even though I only live 2 blocks away.<//review>

Definitely the Bike shop you want to go to in Santa Cruz!

After going to multiple established local Santa Cruz Bike shops and being disappointed with horrible service and selection, I decided to take a peak at this recently opened shop. After walking in, you can immediently noticed the care taken to make the store seem clean and welcoming. The selection of bikes and accessories is amazing! I was welcomed by Sean the store manager and could not believe I finally found someone who appeared to enjoy their job!  He noticed I was a novice to biking quickly and walked me through the fitting and matinence process slowly. I even got to test and ride the bike around town!!

Everyone has to make this place a stop if your considering purchasing a beautiful new bike!!< /text>

<Review>I have been a regular at Epicenter since I moved here four years ago when they had only been open for short time. The shop has always been very friendly and has helped me out a ton over the years with everything cycling related. I've been to a lot of different bike shops and Epicenter is definitely one of the most organized and well thought out shops I've ever seen. Epicenter has also put in a ton of effort to better the entire cycling community in the Santa Cruz and Aptos areas. They built the immensely popular Aptos pumptrack and donated tons of time and effort to the build the new flow trails in Pogonip and Demo Forest. And with shops in two locations on both side of town, Epicenter is always close by, no matter where you decide to ride.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>Would be more stars if it wasnt for the fact you have to pay to use the restroom. I was doing laundry with my 4yr old daughter and she needed to use the restroom I used my change for our laundry, little did I know you need to pay to use the restroom which is illegal in CA btw. So needless to say I will not be coming here again, nor would I recommend this location to anyone.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>The first time I went to this laundromat the owner told me he was new and had just bought the place and was fixing it up. I was pleased to see that the customers didn't have to stand the whole time because he had seating all around. He also said he was getting new machines. I can tell he is doing what he said because when I use his machines they ring all the water out of my clothes to the point where they don't have to dry long. The best part I loved was when I went there the owner asked me did my clothes come out clean? I said yes. He said if they didn't I will wash them over again for free. Over all the owner is a very nice guy and his son is to. I still go there twice a week. They don't charge much it's $1.50 for the regular machines and the price goes up the bigger the machine gets. But the regular machines fit a big load in them.  It's always clean when I go because I usually get there around 8:00am. Thank you for your good service.< /text>< Response>

Clean, best dryers, open early and closed late! Wheel chair access,  sitting areas, if you don't have any soap laundry bags or dryer sheet etc best to believe they have it on deck for you! Very very very respectable workers always cleaning changing linen catcher all that it's in the corner but you can't help but see the huge laundry mat sign<//review>

<text>I’ve washed here before & had no issue Came in today, washed and dried Then as I was folding I noticed 3 of my loads were STILL DIRTY. Idk what happened w the washers this time. I was trying to call someone using the number online and it kept ringing. I knocked on the doors to see if anyone was there & no one! I had to re wash and dry all 3 loads! Not to mention money that I’ve already wasted but also more wash soap. I guess I’m more upset no one is at the shop to help me out w the issue. I get the washers mess up but they definitely need someone on site for stuff like this.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< userid>

Was there this morning the person who opens it didn't do it till 7:45 and she was rude when I said somthing about it. For the other people who comment this is the best laundromat I shudder at your low expectations of other places. They are barely even starting to upgrade the machines this month and a quarter of them were broken!!!. The place was dirty and the lady from three months ago didn't care the one who opened it. People there are better place out there just look for one.< /review>

With the laundrymat at the perfect plaza, it has big machines with the right price, the right loads, and enough baskets and tables to fold your clothes, plus a restaurant and liquor store between the two, it attracts more business< /Text>

I agree with the lady below, best laundrymat in fontana, which isn't saying much. Prices are average if you use the multi load washers (4 loads for $3.25) dry is about $1, but has the same issues all fontana mats do, put in a .25 at a time, check the heat often.<//text>

(Translated by Google) The machines were fine, where the roll of paper they have is useless, they struggle to take out the paper and this half dirty I think they should keep cleaner.

One promise they have posted on the wall says "fun, friendly, ...... people who exceed customer expectations... Unmatched cleanliness... And superior service" I did not get that promise when I was there. It was more nutrual and typically service. It was not horrible service... It was just not what they promised. It was a little dusty, dirty, and the windows where stained. Bathroom said out of order with a sign made out of computer paper and markers. I'm being a bit critical cus of the promise they have on the wall. It's not a bad place it's just nit what they promised.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUuqNfaDfpJ1t4ldAU4YLHS6RixTyI6IzBw16_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqol_xDsUEBowD4FIevjjTxrkoWqXFcGHoRhwc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoiN48nuKfzlvL1PAX0lHcBN8gjhRI54qhC7mI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvjqIKa4ZqCJZ04nTD090-gAYuodjuKuFtRdWB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

But I guess one of the work was probably in a bad mood because she had no smile and really didn't give us on any details on what size or a cone if we want. Just a bad attitude.  Other than that the ice cream was good. Undecided if we would go back to this location<//review>< Pictures>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>Well, I have tried their Chocolate Lava Meltdown; it contains chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream.

* The chocolate cake is not the best, it tastes like regular cakes; it's good but not super; I rate it 3 stars.

* The vanilla ice cream tastes better, my rating is 3.5 stars for the vanilla.

* general atmosphere inside is pretty good.

* however, I had an issue with the staff. I came at 9:45pm and ate inside. Then, at 10pm sharp one of the staff approached me although I hadn't finished eating and said they should lock the door and so I should leave because they close at 10pm.
Okay, yes, he said that politely, but I have never seen a store in the US where they make someone leave immediately when it closes. All of the stores I know let you stay in until you finish if you came early!!! I hope someone corrects me if I'm mistaken!

That's the reason why I rated it 2 stars. If that had not happened, my rating would be 3 stars.</Text>< Pictures>

I prefer Baskin Robin's...the service is slow and there is always a wait, and the ice cream is nothing special.< /Review>

Connor is a ROCKSTAR Employee! We arrived @ 9pm on Memorial Day. Only 2 employees scheduled & the line was continually out the door. Connor greeted everyone and apologized for the wait. Wish I could post a video. Give this boy a raise!< /Text>

< Review>
Cynthia on the Sunday night crew is the rudest worker I have ever encountered. The thing is she knew she was being rude and once brought to her attention, became ruder. I didn't even want to order after experiencing her. I guess it the area.< /Review>

How about if you guys do your job and stop chattering away when you have customers then maybe your "starving college student" tip jar would have more than pennies in it. The black girl overcharged me.<//Text>

<text>LACC is a great community college that has exceeded my expectations!

If you are looking to transfer, then the counselors have your back. They make it easy for you to understand. This is also a great place to simply take classes.
They also have good benefits such as mental health services for their students.

Most professors are chill and the campus is lovely.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2c750ca6eed1d:0x1f85c8d4d78504b</gmap_id><username>trish finance<//username>< response>

< Review>
The Best Cactus shop in Town. The manager here is getting to the bottom of what happen at another. I still support Cactus 🌵 just had a bad experience at #3 but I understand things happen. Still this one has California Burritos and great style of Mexican dishes. Thanks for confirming the Cactus tradition with me.<//Review>

Graduated here in 2018, great community college. Yes the school is not perfect. but it is affordable and offers all sorts of programs for students or people who are interested in learning a new skill. Only downside is the homeless/crackheads who easily make their way in the school's restroom and leave all their mess inside. A bit more security is needed also because of the area surrounding the school. Also, the lack of good professors can be difficult but overall it's a good community college!</review>

<text>I attended a number of semesters here, first one was Spring 2002 semester. Loved this campus since I was a kid though, in the 1980s, visiting the campus. Beautiful campus, one of the embodiments of the spirit of East Hollywood. The campus has changed significantly over the years, I like both the old and new versions. And both the old and new library. If you're not looking to attend, the campus is also a great place to just chill for a bit, take a walk through here, sit, read. You can even grab some food from the food truck that's usually on campus when classes are in session. Or read some books at the nice LACC library, though you can't check them out unless you're enrolled. They used to have some books for sale there too. Maybe sometimes they still do. Check library hours and whether they are closed until the next semester of classes begins, as they often do that.<//text><userid>100659278847811433664</userid><Time>1580534531372<//Time><GmapID>0x80c2c750ca6eed1d:0x1f85c8d4d78504b<//GmapID>< user_name>

My first impression is based on the communication and interaction I've received from staff as a new student. I understand we are in the middle of a pandemic but the lack of response from the Admissions Office and Counseling Department has led me to believe this institution couldn't care any less if I reach my educational goals with them or not. I have been given the runaround for the last 2 months regarding my status as a new student and what is required of me. Their website states that in order to receive Priority Registration you must complete the requirements listed on your Student Portal by May 29, 2020, well my Student Portal hasn't been updated since I applied. There is no confirmation that my transcripts have been received and I can't even get in touch with anyone to confirm this. On top of this requirement being needed to complete my registration I also am required to speak with a Counselor, in April I was told I could do this via their LIVE CHAT but the Counselor's don't even respond to the chats and 99% of the time they have their status as Offline or Away. If you're lucky to get a hold of a Counselor during the LIVE CHAT they leave you unanswered for 30+ minutes in hopes that you'll just close out the chat and if they do respond they give you short answers and attitude. Because I have college credits I received outside of LACC I actually can't talk to someone via LIVE CHAT. I have to schedule an appointment with a Counselor. I submitted a request for a Counseling Appointment on May 1, 2020 and in the confirmation email I received I was told someone would be in touch with me, two weeks passed and I heard nothing so I was told by a Success Coach in the LIVE CHAT to follow-up with an email to Online Counseling. Today I emailed the Counseling Dept. to check the status of my request and I learn that there are no appointments available at this time and to check back the week of May 26 to schedule an appointment again, yet in order for me to receive Priority Registration I need to have all of this completed by May 29th! I attempted to LIVE CHAT with THREE counselors this afternoon, 2/3 never responded and 1 took 45 minutes to respond only to tell me the LIVE CHAT is for "quick fixes" and to schedule an appointment again with Online Counseling even though I told him I've already done that and the email referred me to speak to someone via LIVE CHAT, his response was to submit another request. I think it's safe to say I won't meet the deadline even though I've been trying to get all of this taken care of since March! It's not fair that I have to penalized for missing the deadline when I've made every attempt and used every resource the college provides to get my new student requirements completed. I was so excited to get back into school so I could finish my degree but this experience has left me feeling so discouraged. Never has a college/university made me feel this way. We are all having to adjust to the way we interact with each other because of this pandemic so I understand the changes but communication should remain the same. Your students shouldn't feel like they are being left in the dark. The last school I attended answered my questions by communicating effectively and handled my request efficiently when I was reaching out to get my transcripts DURING THE PANDEMIC and I'm not even a student there anymore, yet I can't even get an email update from LACC that my transcripts were received. I am very unhappy with my experience and I am considering withdrawing my application all together until this pandemic blows over, I have a feeling that's what they want me to do anyway as it one less person that have to help. Also, update your website. It's so scattered with inconsistent fonts, sizes, colors, and links that appear clickable but aren't which makes it overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate.</text>

This school was great when I first attended it back in 2010-2012. I am trying to return to it but it has changed so much. The campus isn't as nice as it use to look and the staff are very rude. For some reason, I could not log onto the computers on campus due to an error on the school's end and the librarian was accusing me of wanting to surf the web for leisure when in actuality, I wanted to add a class before taking a walk down the admins&records. When I got to admins&records, I waited a few hours to get my name changed on their system to my new last name. I brought passport, SSN, birth certificate, marriage certificate, student ID number. I was told that everything was processed and fine. Now I am told that I  need to go back and wait in another four hour line because "there must be a glitch in the system and those documents were not documented" Another error on their end and I'm not given an option that would not require me waiting in such a long line. Tried getting a student ID and I was told after all that waiting that day "Oh, my supervisor needs to be present for that. That person should be back in an hour or so, I think" I wasn't going to wait any longer that day. This place hired bright, college students with a sense of professionalism and now it seems to be different. Getting a response over e-mail hasn't happened, a month later and  . Hopefully the classes are still good. Oh, and every Thursday I am to wait online at a certain time and try booking an appointment with a counselor to discuss transferring. It has been over two months and even if I am on the dot of when the booking page is open, I still haven't been able to secure an appointment. They book out in seconds. I wonder how many more months it will be before this question can be answered.</review>

For professors... do your research on ratemyprofessor and you will be fine, they have never steered me wrong. Thus, I have never had a bad experience with the instructors at this campus. Besides that, I honestly don't know why they bother hiring ANYONE at the student services building when all they do is lead you back to information on the website! It's absolutely ridiculous. The counselors are hard to reach, the business center gives you the run around on almost all matters, and they have the nerve to put the rudest lady at the information desk who literally never has an answer to any question. I agree with other reviews that dealing with the staff in this campus can very much feel like dealing with the DMV. The library is a joke, they allow homeless people to nap inside and the people there to help when asked questions hardly ever have an answer.  So if you can avoid it, I advice you to save yourself the hassle, reserve your positive energy and handle all of your matters online! I will say however that the friendliest staff I have encountered are the janitors, I wish they would hire more of them as the cleanliness in this campus could be improved dramatically.<//Review>

Faculty here is very rude and controlling, they want to do the least amount of work as possible. You will be scoffed at and given dirty looks if you don't know the exact answer for their questions. Not very welcoming and not very helpful, at least for the office people, reminds me of the DMV 🤢<//review>

Looks like a great campus with a great location. Went to a College to Counselor Summit event that was really cool to expose the school and its services it provides.  The freshmen are well looked after by a unique program they have.  You can get college internship credit for working in your field! They have great career paths.< /review>

Student Service Building is a newer building. You can register the classes, pay the tuition fees and apply financial aid at this building.

There is a food truck at the courtyard, selling beverages and snacks.

The Parking: Parking lot 1 & 2 are across street from the campus. Daily parking fee $2. Parking lot 3 is right next to Student Service Building. The entrance to Parking lot 3 is not on Vermont Ave, side street near Melrose.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The financial aid office is awful, be ready to wait from 30-60 minutes unless you go there in the morning.

Admission can't even talked about them cause they lost 4 times my transcripts. 2 in which Santa Monica college send and 2 which I personally dropped off. Management is bad. No wonder a few years ago they were going to get shut down. They need to team up wth Santa Monica college and learn from them. Instead of investing on expanding there campus, fix the current campuses you have. Bring better professor invest in that. whats the point of having a phone in admissions if they never reply? Financial Aid is all jacked up staff doesn't know what their doing. Why hire people who lose paper work and don't know what their doing. If i was in charge of that school i would fire everybody their useless.<//Review>< gmap_id>

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Five stars go to their professors and instructors.

⭐️⭐️⭐️ Three stars for their food places and poor healthy food selection.

⭐️ One star goes to an inadequate person working at the student services department and answering phones. I wish I had her name. Giving wrong hours of operation is unacceptable. Even after I asked 2 more times to confirm, because the hours were also listed on the website and I was getting suspicious. Basic training 101 was clearly missed.< /Review>

It's close to my house and classes are great with the help of awesome teachers.
Taking child development and it's great so far.....
I recommend that everything must be done online yourself, asking for help at LACC isn't guaranteed because there students also. Keeping your things in order, neatly, and on time will help you with classes, financial aid etc...
GOOD LUCK!!!</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><date>1354778803424< /date><Review>This is a wonderful school, the professors are not hit and miss, its just that you have to ask before you take just any professor, but its not a bad idea to adjust to the varying professing styles that they employ at the school.  This would be the ideal school to attend if you are seeking to transfer considering this is only a 2 year college and would prepare you for transfer the lecture styles of various professors at standard 4 year universities; while gaining entry into the 4 year as a junior and with an AA in the field of study.  The financial aid process has become very bureaucratic considering they ensured the right information was given and the process which to go about correcting if there was problem.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Los Angeles City College has a wide range of classes that covers most everything. I’m never disappointed with the classes I enrolled in. The best part is there is a metro subway station entrance at the northeast corner of the campus so ride the metro and get to class in a relaxed state of mind.< /Text>

<Text>I'm a journalism major and the classes here are a waste of time!  The only reason I attended this school was because it was highly recommended from my past teacher.  So, instead of going straight to Cal State Long Beach I went here.  My first semester on the Collegian newspaper was a horrible experience. I went there to learn how to write better get published articles for an internship at the LA Times.  What a load of crap.  The paper is run by the students, so they pick and choose what students publish and the teacher and department head can't do a thing about it. I made several complaints yet I saw no change. I was really disappointed in the time I wasted here. I really was looking forward to learning how to become a better writer and journalist. Now I'm only enrolling next semester  just for the credits I need transfer, I might as well it's not like they truly care. My suggestion for those who are journalism majors, DO NOT attend here and attend another school like Pierce College. I had a better experience there and the instructors are now involved unlike here at LACC. It's just too far now that I'm working closer to home.  Good luck!< /Text>< Rate>

<Text>I hate this college because they protect a unprofessional microbiology professional named David Sanchez.  Please don't take his class. You would be regret it and he would ruin your life. He sexual harass me during his lecture and have been calling my cell phone and stalking me for a long time. I rejected him then he lower my exam grade on purpose. I only got a B because of I rejected him. He is mental unstable and crazy. He is very unprofessional.
This college won't fire him after I report such a bad evil person.  Please go to another better college.  This college would ruin your life!  It is the worst!<//Text>< Pictures>

This collage is alright. Nothing special. Sime teachers are great, I really do like them. They are remodeling and expanding which is great, means is improving. Some classrooms are disgusting specially at the science building, smells awful and not all rooms are air conditioned. I do like the math buildings, they are nice and clean. The library is nice to, a lot of book selection, 3 floors and i like the huge glass windows.</Text>

Some of the classrooms have no windows which feels prison-y but they certainly have a lot of classes which is nice.< /review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>Majored in Cinema & Television.... Good instructors but absolutely NO true internships. Totally bogus.
Also having 0 Sports teams, we did not have any way to gain real field experience using related equipment on location. I STILL get questions from potential employers and contacts who ask "How the hell did your college (In the 2nd largest city in the US) NOT have a sports program???

Nearly EVERY school of higher learning with a television program has a SPORTS team of some kind .....OR......PARTNERS with another school or schools with proper equipment and some type of sport so students can shoot, edit, operate mobile unit and microwave, commentate on camera, ENG, etc... So that way one can leave with a bit more confidence, live remote experience and of course...a REEL.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Went to trade tech and asked about a program they offered they said unfortunately the only school the program ABA approved was LACC. The counselor still helped me to the best and said she wish she knew more about the program LACC offered. So I drive 30 min to LACC. The people at LACC we’re so rude. Went to the first floor and asked excuse me mam where’s the counselors office she’s Rudly says can you read and points to the sign. Okay I went to the second floor, and I asked the guy can i talk to a counselor he’s like what do you need help with I told him and he tosses me some papers comes outside and says this is what you need I’m like what are the prerequisites for this class. “Um look online.” And Im like okay sir can you please help me he’s like that’s all to it takes these classes and that’s it. Okay okay and looks at me with a blank face. I was so confused as to how this guy became a counselor. Very rude and was in a rush to take lunch/ talking to his co workers. Sadly I have to come back to this school because it’s ABA approved. They treat you mean and talk to you threw. Glass window where everyone can hear your business. I felt as if I was at the DMV or something. They need to retrain these people to at least be nice and helpful.< /Text>< gmapID>

I attended classes here for about 2 1/2 years, and very much enjoyed my time there. The thing about this place that many people don't understand is that it's not a big place, it's not very popular, but it's incredibly accessible, more so than Santa Monica College, at least, which is a good thing for people who can't or won't go all the way out there for whatever reason. Everything is easily walkable and there are a ton of places to eat. Unfortunately, oftentimes you'll find that classes have been overfilled and have a waiting list, but there are usually more than enough classes, depending on the subject. A lot of the teachers here really know what they're talking about, even the adjunct professors. This IS a smoke free campus, so you'll find that most people smoke around the entrances, which can be a bit annoying, but it's just what happens. I say give this place a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much you learn and how much more comfortable you are being able to literally walk here, instead of taking a 2+ hour bus ride elsewhere.<//review>

The financial aid department seems very under qualified. Their lack of experience and lack of helpfulness resulted in my financial aid being late.

Every attempt I have made to make an appointment with a counselor has been futile. I have tried over the course of months and there have never been any dates available. I tried using the online counseling service and have never received a response. I'm in my second semester and I don't even know if I'm taking the right classes because I've never spoken with a counselor.

I also almost spent 260.00 on a book that the bookstore had labeled as a required text for one of my classes. It would have been a final sale. Luckily, I went to class before purchasing it and learned that they are no longer using that book. Even though the bookstore had it clearly labeled under that class/section number.

Every aspect of this school, besides the actual classes are just unorganized and unsympathetic. I guess you shouldn't expect much from a community college, but I'd expect a little more of any place I'm giving money.<//Text>< Pictures>

I like LACC.. It offers reasonable courses for credit or non credited classes..i.e ESL (English Second Lang)..music..martial arts..yoga..fitness..and more!! Parking is tricky. Secure car if left to park on street.  There is improvenrnt last few years..more attractive..better security. Good enhancement for many careers starters. I have taken several classes here..they were very rewarding and helped in my career to increase income..instructor was great. Good non credit classes ..Piano and Pilates was reasonable and great..this was a few years ago tho. But I have seen rosters and keep up as I have also take n intermittent personal interest classes  (culinary, fictional writing and marketing).Nice school. DO NOT WALK ALONE OUTSIDE AFTER DARK UNESCORTED..NEIGHBORHOOD IS SKETCHY..FOR BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS!!!  BOYS ARE VICTIMS TOO.< /review>

This school’s administration is full of irresponsible people who don’t know what they’re doing. One person passes the blame onto another, that person onto another, and it’s all one vicious cycle.

The counselors give you incorrect guidance (they don’t seem to know UC or CSU requirements), please beware that you should speak to multiple counselors just to cross check that what you’re being told is accurate. Also, keep in mind that if you make afternoon appointments with counselors they might “call in sick” without bothering to ask someone to contact their appointments so they can save themselves the trip ( I lost an afternoon of work, gas, and time because of a counselor’s inability to let me know that he wasnt going to meet me for our scheduled appointment).

The Admissions and Records as well as Financial Aid offices are as helpful as speaking to a blind deaf mute. You go, and you go, and you go, trying to get answers to simple questions like, why hasn’t my home school been changed since I came in early February to have it changed? They send you from one office to another and not even they have the answer to that (thank God they at least have all the offices in one building). I’ve gone to try and change my home school from Trade Tech to LACC on five separate occasions and nothing yet. Oh, and forget about calling the offices, they will never answer.

Yet SURPRISINGLY they need to increase their enrollment rates because it’s been decreasing for some time now. Weirdly, though , with the new system in use students are “accidentally” enrolled in courses they never signed up for.  Then students are later berated by school staff as to why they never bothered to show up to class when you try to petition the courses you originally never signed up for (btw tracking down some of the Professors is more appropriate a job for a private investigator than a student).

Avoid the school if you can, I will transfer out as soon as is possible for me.< /text>

Location is getting worse. There is an increase in homeless people around campus. Professors have become MUCH worse. For the first time, I reported a professor (Spanish professor Leyva) and NOTHING was done about it. It's so awful here! I am looking for classes at ELAC, when talking to a security officer about what to do about what my professor was doing to me, she told me to just go to ELAC and that's why she takes no classes here. I am not going to be attending this college anymore. Taking courses at Los Angeles Southwest college and their Child Development program is SO much better. This place has nothing to offer I suggest going elsewhere.</Text>

<Text>I do agree with the financial aid office problems, since they also kept giving me the wrong dates and info, other than that most of my teachers are great and well prepared. If you can talk to the students attending there and find out what teachers are good it would be in your best interest because my math teachers teaching techniques are soo bad that I might fail the class if I don't teach the subject to myself.<//Text>< Rating>

The best place for thieves,I am high school student and I ride a bike.I parked my bike at LACC and went to class,my class is ESL 3B it is in evening from 6:50 pm thru 10:00 pm,so somebody steal my flashlight from my bike and I decided to home at night without flashlight,it is wasn't usually flashlight it was 10 in 1 flashlight I bought it for 80$ bucks, it has a Bluetooth speaker,phone holder,flashlight,powerbank,fm radio and many other things.I am really disappointed and I think that thieve was student from college< /text>

<Review>I enjoyed attending this college! It is straightforward and there are so many classes. I was pregnant as soon as I finished high school so I decided to enroll at LACC and completed courses on campus and many more online. After 2 years, I am happy to say that this school has helped me transfer to USC !! Thank you LACC!< /Review>< Pictures>

The class i took was excellent but the financial aid department is garbage! they've sent my higher one card to an address which i never gave them and basically have me fending for myself with no type of help or services to correcting their mistakes. I'm frustrated dealing with a institution that does not want to help with their own faults and i have to buy books for my class. I am dropping myself from this school in total this week. Thanks LACC for nothing< /Review>

< Review>
Its probably due to 19 but my transcript never got scanned by two colleges in lacc.  It was there quite a bit early.  I'm supposed to get two AA I doubt I'll get any now.  I took over 33 credits in cinema and had the cinematography certificate.  However I got very little assistance to get the cinema AA even though it's the same requirements.  I had a little more classes I still wanted to take but probably will stop going to school due to the lack of ability to get assistance when I had met the requirements.

Also don't take okamara for photography.

I had really liked this school and thought it was a good school.  After finally getting an internship I asked a basic question about being in a two credit class am I getting credits for my internship in addtion to that. While I got email replies the school has not been able to give me a appropriate answer in a week. Even the dean just told me I was registered. I had actually considered dropping my internship but I got something in my area finally.  It's so sad many people have jobs here and just don't do them.

Ps when u go to a class and listen to people ask questions for five hours you are basically listening to questions its not really a class.  I don't go to listen to questions and its a waist of my time and learning to do so.

Read Juan Caro review and I even made suggestions too the faculty much of it was just swept under because it's more work for them and they even had a class I took which would incorporate it.  Faculty didn't really care or at all respond even when I took the remote class which would do the sports lacc had.

I actually believe some staff just reply to emails without reading them even if you complain they don't read that.< /Review>

< review>
The Counselors give out wrong information regarding the classes I need to take to graduate and transfer to the CSU I got accepted into. They also give students false information and the staff doesn't even know the updates they place for student information. I seen a disabled person walking lost because the staff didn't know where the orientation was for her. I felt so bad. She couldn't walk a lot but they still didn't mind giving her the run around. Smh. They need to communicate better with each other. Also the hours they display they should be there on time for those hours! This is my last semester, Thank God!< /review>

registrar doesn't do their job at all.
Person named WINNIE is very rude and she shouldn't work there.
They for some reason had 2 ID's under my name.
I had hard time pulling my transcript due to this reason.
and all she was able to tell me was, "Just email us, i'll respond within 10 business days".

Great cinema programs, especially for the price. Mr walzer(humanities), Mcevety(kinesiology) B.m. Medrano (history) and Danielle Stallings(cinema) are just a few of the notable staff. This is also one of the most diverse colleges in the country. I highly recommend LACC. I would have given LACC 5 stars but the library computers are garbage.<//Review>

The restrooms in the science building have no locks. Waiting on the admissions and records and Financial Aid Office is way too long and they aren't helpful. I've been trying to pay my classes for a month now, the business lady says "You are not on the system, go down to tell Admissions Office". I wait 30 min and she can't hep me and that's her only answer. Not Helpful at all.<//review>

<Text>Overall I like this school a lot. I would have gave it four stars but I'll explain my reasons. I do give it 4 stars for the education to price ratio, it is probably one of the best investments IF you know what you want to do in life.

It's almost impossible to get the important transferrable college unit classes you need because of over crowding (which is typical for Jr.Colleges). But there are too many students who are not serious about education, so they take up space in a class, and end up dropping within a month. e.g. On average i have had three classes that were packed full of 40+ students, by the middle of semester my class sizes dwindled down to less than 20 (sadly los angeles dropout rates are so high). Now I understand that this is the student's fault not the school's but i disagree because the registration dates for students seemed to be done by raffle and not by gpa/units completed. And they need to add more prerequisite for the intensive science classes (they say they have changed it starting 2014 but we'll see).

Theres always construction. Never ending construction. You would think that this a good think but it's only good if the construction doesn't lasts years. when I started going to this school there was construction, my sister who went 4 years before said there was a lot construction too. I kind of just wish the work was done so we could have more available classes. Also the quality of professors is sporadic, theres are a lot extremely capable well informed professional professor, mixed with lousy ones, and there seems to be few who are in between. I have passed a class leaving with the thought of "what the hell did i just learn anyways?" from this class.. not a really good feeling considering I'm paying to be educated and not paying to just earn free units.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>international student center is a total joke and they dont want to help you.
they are kind only to their russian fellas because they dont have to speak english to them.
except for one lady who was helpful and nice, all of them are rude and stuck up two faces
international students are paying way more money than regular students and they are treated as little kids who dont deserve to be in there.
staff themselves has huge accent and are not good at english, but when international  student who just arrived to this country, go to the office and ask a question, and of course they have accent and make mistakes, ask to repeat the sentence again because its not their native language! then they look at them like a dumbass and give that face and voice tone.
this is total waste of money and time.
If students who are considering to come to this school from another country reconsider it. just go to college that is in your country and get the better education and be treated as an equal human being.< /review>< Pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2c750ca6eed1d:0x1f85c8d4d78504b<//Gmap_id><Review>Ive found that the best thing to do, is always,check your answered questions, and get second opinions, talk to a student already there, if your waiting in a line for 6 hours, you could exchange phone numbers, or conversations, with others, to see how things are going and get feedback..the night before, write down,all questions, and then ask the person, who is answering your question, pertinent after questions, like is there a possible problem with this, "Am I asking the question I need to ask...etc etc...hey, thats the way the world, works,and as for the gentelman, who said, student and faculty were sick, blowing their noses, etc..really? okay, here goes, maybe wear a mask like they do in the asian countries, so you dont catch or pass germs (see pandemic,comming down the pike,Hey it could happen, ,its called thinning the herd..LOL) wash your hands!! institutions, are filthy...everything you touch, has had hands, that have not washed, then you bring that,hand and pinky to your face and nose...voila..now your sick, I like soap and water..better than the bacterial gels, but its more convienent..carry it, also note, bacterial gels, dont work over the long haul..(look it up) it doesnt kill germs after a while (soap and H2 0) is the best...ps. those antibacterial soaps, also affect the thyroids, (look it up) yea, washing your hands, with that, stuff...affects the function of your thyroids..saw it in a magazine, and heard it once on the telly..so people...you have to take "RESPONSILBILTY" for your own "SELF" your out in the world now...you think,la city college is bad, try taking your pal, to the verterans hospital...talk about shifless, and just dont give a rats petutti...so I wonder why doesnt someone, get a website and charge monies, to assist the kids, down in the line, to make it easier,for them to get their answers and the like?? that would be a job? right? you could pass out flyers to the people waiting in the line...hey look,you made a new job, or something....oh and lastly..perhaps people waiting on you at the school, would be a little bit nicer, if people would say things, like..Good Morning, how are you...and then, please...and then,. Thankyou...at the end. I use to wait on the public..waitressed. sometimes, I wanted to ask...but thought it in my head..."was the ground cold, when you got up this morning"  so now! go out there and be kind to your fellow humans, politness,goes a long way.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I love it since they have None credit classes, something I saw that I have not seen in other schools, is that if you take the GED class and have good attendance and get a good percentage, they give you the opportunity to take the free exam. Which I have not seen in other schools.

Me encanta ya que tienen clases de None credito,algo que vi que no e visto en otros colegios, es que si tomas la clase de el GED y tienes buena asistencia y sacas buen porcentaje enclase, te dan la oportunidad de tomar el examen gratis. Cosa que no e visto en otros colegio.<//Text>

Order was quick & easy. Ordered tablecloths and let me tell you they have a variety of colors, color tones were texted over to me. Made payment through Zelle. Shipping took a little longer than expected but received my order a few days after. Recommend them.<//Text>

<Review>Terrible experience. I had called weeks in advance to find out information for a custom order for a jumper. I was told that it could be done. Took a drive out to the location and the older lady was rude and seemed really bothered to help me. Overall just a bad experience. Do not recommend.<//Review>< pictures>

Recommend this place, bought my first order of two jumpers beginning of last year and recently added a new unit as well. They let my husband modify the colors to my taste. The wait was a bit longer than expected but I love my new unit. Will be back soon hopefully< /review>

Price gougers!  The price quoted on the jumper of the phone was different when I arrived.  This is false advertising.  I am reporting this business to the authorities.<//text>

Great products and customer service! Love the variety of products they carry in the warehouse. I bought chairs, tables, EZ UP canopy, patio lights, runners, piñata and table cloths for personal use at home. Glad I was able to find them online. Next purchase might be more chairs and tables and maybe even a jumper for gatherings at home.<//review>

Unfortunately, the W-9 form was sent to us exactly the same as we had forwarded to you. We requested numerous amount of times for it to be filled out completely and singed however, we were not able to accomplish that. As head of the office I should have pushed forward to completing that form. Again, I am very sorry for the inconvenience. I want to thank you for bringing this issue to my/our attention. We are always looking for ways to better our service, and your feedback is an invaluable part of that process.

< review>
I bought the taco grill and it was missing a piece .. I called 6/14 at 1220pm and I tried to explain the gal what was wrong . I couldn't really explain it to her. So answered rudely saying that "if you don't know how to explain it then just bring it in" she could have said sorry about your expirence, but she just wanted to end the conversation! Hopefully hey fix their customer service because it's terrible! The loading guys outside are great and were very helpful ! But the people inside are not nice! Considering the part I spent thousands of dollars there!< /review>

We had previously rented a van from the Redwood City Uhaul and had an overall negative experience (took an hour to check in with 1 person in front of us, had to redo all the online information in person, charged more than initially expected).  This was the exact opposite of that.  There's no parking in the lot so you park on El Camino but the check in process was easy, quick, the customer service rep was friendly and helpful, and the price was exactly as advertised.  We would rent from here again.<//Review>

<text>I was charged for the 3 GL of fuel I didn't use because of the incorrect amount of the fuel that was set initially during equipment pickup process. When I complained about the fuel charge, the employee at the counter just kept repeating "You clicked approve, You clicked approve". Yes I clicked the approve button because I thought uhaul employee would've set it correctly (Why wouldn't you?). Apparently the uhaul employee at this branch didn't do their job well. You could've set the correct fuel amount to begin with.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I had reserved a truck one month prior to our moving date. We got a call 18 hours before our reservation start time saying they cant give us our reserved truck. Why, because the messed up and dont have availability any more. My wife and I had the worst week of our lives since we had to settle for a smaller van and move other stuff in our cars. I drove 500+ miles in a week to load/unload our furniture to a safe location. Customer care and on-site staff were not helpful at all (plus they are rude) as they kept asking me to talk to different departments. If our friends and family wouldn't have helped, we were prepared to keep our furniture on the streets.< /text><GmapID>0x808f9f8879dfd36f:0xf8d9b54d98dea276< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

If I could give this place a zero I would. The costumer service is terrible. They just made it so difficult to rent a van. One of the workers made it feel like it was an inconvenience to help me. When you make a reservation here be prepared to deal with impolite and unprofessional staff.</review>

U-Haul as a corporation is failing their workers and their customers. I'm sure they're still making a profit of our backs. Every time I've shown up to the Belmont location something has gone wrong. They haven't had the equipment I need, or I put in that I need the equipment for a longer period of time than what they can allow off their website. And just most recently I had a reservation for a storage unit that doesn't exist. What does exist is a third floor storage unit with no elevator. They have also modified their covid-19 barriers for their employees. And common sense shows that they are putting their customers and their employees at greater risk by creating more holes for them to pass the virus back and forth.  Please wear a good mask when you come in to their location.In my opinion, outside of the local workers who seem to be doing the best that they can with what they are given, U-Haul corporation is dirty and they're just trying to make a profit without delivering a product.</Review>

Stay away from this location at all cost!!!!! This location is mismanagement. We booked a 24foot truck 3 weeks ahead, had movers and everyone ready to go for the moving day. I am 8 1/2 weeks pregnant, So we wanted to rent the biggest truck so we only had to do one trip in case if I need to go to the hospital. On the day of the moving they informed us that our truck of 26feet was overbooked and not available. They said all they had left was 1 smaller truck of 20feet,. My husband had no choice but to take that truck since we had the movers and everyone waiting for the move.
While trying to load the truck we noticed there was glue spilled all over the back of the Truck, making it impossible to utilize the whole truck, on top of that the hinch on the ramp was broken. Not only did we ended up taking longer to upload the truck, but we also could not use the whole truck, being afraid that boxes and furniture might get shifted during the move and fall into that glue.
We called the next day to notify the location that we will need the truck another day given the circumstances that they give us a truck that was not operating correctly.
We got charged $436.36 for 2 days. I am now filling a claim and disputing the charges, for this nightmare experience. Stay away from this location at all cost!!! The manager does not know what he is doing.</Review>

STAY AWAY!!! I reserved a uhaul at this location 15 days prior to my move. At 4pm the day before my move (when I was picking up 3 family members who had FLOWN IN to help me move) I got a text saying I can check in for my uhaul rental... to pick up in SOUTH LAKE TAHOE! And yes I check my original reservation and I had selected this location.

Yep, that’s right. They moved my reservation from 2 minutes up the road to four hours from my apartment. I was on hold for over an hour, spent about 3 minutes talking to customer service only to be put back on hold. At this point, I went up to speak to someone in person. The (extremely rude) guy told me that they don’t have a truck for me (even though there were about 30 trucks in the lot) because “all of these have been reserved for in-town moves”. Yeah. Right.

He wouldn’t do anything for us, Scoffed at me when I said I didn’t want to “call this number” because I had been on hold for over an hour. I even offered to bring the truck back after I move (all the way to LA).

So basically we ended up actually driving to SLT (50 was closed so it took 4 hours), got there at 1am, paid $150 for a hotel room, got 5 hours of sleep and then picked up the uhaul and drove another 4 hours back to the Bay Area to start loading and drive to LA same day.

Do not do business with this disgusting company. We will never use uhaul again and will make sure our friends and family don’t either. Companies shouldn’t be able to get away with this scummy behavior. Be better.<//Review>

I've been a loyal customer for years and generally get great help from the employees.  This time, however, the "manager" Rodney? refused to help me with a very simple trailer hitch reconfiguration.

Literally he refused to turn the ball over on the hitch to fit my truck.  Basically said "figure it out then come get me when you're ready."  Correct me if I'm mistaken but YOU GUYS INSTALL HITCHES FOR A LIVING!!!!

Canceled the trailer and went to UHaul SF and worked with a crew who could not have been nicer.  In an effort to preserve the scare resources that are stars, I'm giving all yours to them.  In fact, if I could save one more, I would.< /Review>

I'm reviewing U-Haul truck rental. My in-town truck rental from Belmont U-Haul was excellent.

I rented a 20 foot truck one day, then a 15 foot truck the following weekend, then a 9 foot van.  Each time, the experience went great.

I was able to use the after-hours truck return system to park and check in the truck using an Android app late at night.  They let me have the truck up to 24 hours for the same one-day price.

There were no unexpected charges during any of my three rentals.

Four stars instead of five because during my first rental, I was new to the whole process and I felt a little bit like the staff was rushing through things and not being 100% patient.  But I understand that customer service is damn hard :)</Text>

Then when I went to another uhaul to pick up the cargo trailer, they said the brake lights weren’t working on the trailer because I’d been sold a bad module with the hitch install. I’m not sure if they didn’t test it after installing or if they just didn’t care that they were selling me a bad part. Not the way I wanted to start my 600 mile move. Would not recommend a hitch install at this location.</Review>< Pics>

It’s amazing how you can ruin a perfectly good business with the wrong staff.

Checked in for a new storage to find the elevator was broken (large truck, big move, multiple staircases make no sense). No big deal, it happens, but no notification was made to let us know, no plan was suggested, no alternatives were noted? The staff offered no solutions and more than that, just didn’t seem to have a clue for us or any of the other interactions happening.< /review>

<resp>None< /resp><Pics>None</Pics><review>Fellow Burners - DO NOT RENT FROM THIS LOCATION

The van was in good condition and we had no issue during our use of it.

Nevertheless less than 5 min after we returned it on September 5th we were asked if we went to Burning Man by an employee and right after we answered in full honesty we were told we would be charged a clean up fee for a few footsteps on the mat located in the van’s loading area.
Despite the fact that the driver’s cabin and the engine were impeccable, the employees and their manager would not accept to admit that their assessment was exaggerated.
We washed the van for 3 hours using high pressure washer in addition to sprays and cloths to remove the dust. These few footsteps had nothing to do with the playa dust and could have come from any place as it was used to load and unload luggage from other places we went (Reno, Tahoe). I wish I could share pictures but in the rush to catch a plane I missed this opportunity.
While I am ok to argue that these foot steps in the loading area could have been removed, the fact that we faced a zealous employee that admitted she knew from the dates we rented the van that we went to Burning Man to me clearly sounds like this agency is on the lookout for extra cash during the Burning Man season.

We’ve rented multiple times one or 2 Uhauls for Burning Man and it’s the first time this happens despite following the same process every year.

In short we felt we were treated unfairly and we do not recommend this location for Burning Man.</review>< Date>

Easy to rent. Good prices, although they expect you to bring back their vehicle with a full tank of gas or they overcharge you to fill it themselves. Clean vehicles.< /text>

< Review>
Terrible - if I could give minus stars I would. Sent here from Redwood City U-haul because they told us this U-haul has storage access until 10pm. It even says 10pm access on their website. We get here at 6.45pm and the staff tell us they'll be closing at 7pm and we can't have access after 7, that there's nothing they can do and their website and colleagues are wrong. A staff member admitted that they could stay but they don't want to go home late. Manager ...useless response 'I'll change the website tomorrow'. President's number no answer. Stuck here with a van full of stuff, 3 cars and nowhere to put it. Thanks u-haul<//Review>

The worst experience in terms of service, also their system does not work had automatic services and made an extra charge of $ 35.00 extra each month and if that were not enough they sent messages that I have to pay when I delivered the warehouse from a month ago. I recommend using other wineries with better service and more economical in bay area.<//text>

<text>Went to go fill up my propane tank, the guy filling it, was belligerent and harassed us during the our time there to the point where we left, we to this day have no idea why the U-Haul guy was so pissed at us.  How difficult is it to just fill up a propane tank?  How hard is it to not harass customers for 10 min?  As I can see from the reviews my experience was not a anomaly.<//text>< Pictures>

Was offered free storage for 1 month by U-Haul and took the offer. I used the free month and after I moved out. 2 Months later I get a bill for the free month. If you have to use U-haul don't store anything here. I'm still fighting them for over 200 in storage fees and late fees for a storage month I didn't fully use and should have been free< /review>

I would have been Greater served by Carrying the desk I had to move on MY BACK!!!...rather than dealing with U-Haul & their collective OVER CHARGING & Complete LACK of Customer Service!!!....

The customer service here is so poor. The workers are not that bright. They do not know anything about the equipment or accessories they sell in their store. And certainly don't try to get a refill on your camping sized propane canister.< /review>

Big Sugar is my absolute favorite bakery in LA. Only 2 tiny shops. And yes I tried Magnolia and almost every other recommended place. Not even close. Today they had my favorite cupcake. Strawberry shortcake. Vanilla cake with fresh strawberries and whipped cream in the center, and a whipped cream frosting. To die for. As are all of their cupcakes and cakes.</review>

<Review>It all started when I had to place a last minute order in. It was just 3 days before my daughters birthday and I inquired through email. Not only were they quick with a response they helped me stay within my budget and through the whole 3 days of email communication they made sure the cake was ready for pickup on Sunday and I was impressed! My girls loved the cake(confetti with strawberry butter creme filling) . It was very beautiful and sweet! First birthday in California and this business was on top with working with me. When I couldn’t make it to the shop to pay upfront before they closed they were convenient with their invoice online! Just a great experience and no disappointment what so ever! From reaching out to them on the 7th to sending my husband for pick up on the 10th it was all a 5 star experience! I’ll forever do business with this bake shop ! Much love!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgi7lR1Kb9UQ7ABZi90Atz7FqaCLvFoOM8xCI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFA2xu5Sx9_lDOC5JPWa17Cj55VbV6gPGgHnk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjAeAa-E4OZaSszlZpqht7Fi_CYzmHtQhQ3rg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bdfcbcdecce1:0x768a6ba3157b5373< /Gmap_id></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I received Big Sugar Bakeshop as a gift from my sister while I was in the hospital because she knows when I feel bad I have a major sweet tooth!  I can be dying but I'll always be hungry😁. And should I not be able to eat I would be dead🙁. So this goes without saying that I ate the entire gift by myself and will personally order from them in the future.  The presentation is so nice and the muffins were delicious.  Big Sugar Bakeshop, you make my life sweeter❤️!< /review>< Pics>

I always drop by this bakeshop every morning to buy bread and pastries. I'm so happy, because they have good bread and pastries, that this bakeshop is near our place. What I like about this bakeshop is that it doesn't make their pastries so sweet.<//review>

We came here to order my sisters wedding cake and I have to say they are so sweet here! The guy who makes the cakes was so kind to us. He sat down with us and went over pictures of his work to make sure he understood exactly what my sister wanted. After that he made a list of all the cakes we wanted to try and made them fresh for us to pick up! The raspberry cake was amazing! And of course his prices are very affordable! So glad we came here!<//review>

Big Sugar is my go-to bakery for sweet treats. Their vegan options are the best that I have ever tasted. Their non-vegan treats are also amazing. The Belgian Chocolate cupcake is a must for dark chocolate lovers. Velvety rich frosting that is never too sweet. The cake is super most. Their hand pies are addictive.<//text>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>I booked my wedding at The Castaway. the cake was included in the package. I planned the wedding in a very short time, so I just picked the first vendor on their list.
After I had placed the order, I called to make a change the man who answered the phone had a heavy accent and was very rude. However, a woman ended up helping me and she was nice. My cake was on time, beautiful and delicious.</text>< pics>

We had these mini bundt cakes as wedding favors, and in one words, they were absolutely incredible! So moist, fluffy, decadent. I will be ordering these for my upcoming wedding as well. I'd rate them 6 stars if I could!</review>

This is a bakery is not really a French patisserie, more like a bake shop with Armenian style sweets and some basic pastries.  I've been here a few times because I like to support local business but the pastries are not very good and the customer service could be so much better. If either the food or the service was good I would definitely go often but I'm sad to say it's just not worth it. I was so excited to be walking distance from a bake shop but it was not meant for to be< /text>

Skip everything and go straight for the Banana Pudding, trust me.  It's so ridiculously good and I'm not even very fond of bananas or pudding.  Cakes/cupcakes are dry and tastes VERY homemade?<//Review>

I've seem this place on IG.. a lot of hipsters go here so I was wondering why. I stumbled up on it when I visited highland park looking for coffee. I couldn't pass the croissant since they are famous for it. I got the ham and cheese, frosty flakes cookies with coffee. Everything was SO delicious. I think that was the best croissant I had in years. The Americano was smooth and perfect for the pastries we got. I love interior design because it's simple, straight forward and still sophisticated!
I highly recommend it.<//Review>

<text>I love this place! Have gotten 2 cakes from them and other treats. Everything is delicious! Kaitlin who is one of the staff members there helped me on a recent cake order and I can’t say enough nice things about her!!  She was attentive to what I needed and worked with me until we designed the perfect cake.  Kaitlin immediately would follow up on emails and phone calls. It’s rare to receive customer service on that level nowadays.  I had called other cake places and it seemed no one would call me back or follow up but after experiencing this bake shop and such FRIENDLY staff - I will always order my cake from them! :)<//text>< Pics>

<review>My boss ordered a large gluten free vanilla cake with pink frosting for her daughters first birthday last month and it was the best thing I ever tasted in my entire long life. And I am not a cake person. But I wanted to marry this cake and take it home with me and have it all to myself. 😂<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><GmapID>0x80c2bdfcbcdecce1:0x768a6ba3157b5373< /GmapID>< user>

I needed a cake last min for my sons 5th bday, I don’t know much about cake sizes or anything like that off the top of my head but there website makes it SO easy to place an order, they have a cake sizing chart, a list of cake flavors & a list of the type of frosting you can choose from. Very simple ordering process !!! and the customer serious rep that took my order over the phone was so nice !!!!! I would definitely recommend!!!!<//Review>

I took a dozen to a friend's dinner party and everyone was thankful :)  I also love their cute items you can browse through before you go to pick out what items you would like.  Really cute books and plates, etc.

I must remember to get a special ordered cake here some time. They always have such great flavor combos but I always seem to forget until it's too late :(</Text>< Rate>

They have one vegan dessert which is the chocolate cupcake with vanilla icing. It was amazing!! I'm definitely coming back. I traveled here from the east coast so I hope theyll have one or two more vegan cupcake options next time I come.</Review>

< Review>
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! We just moved here from NYC and it was our daughters Birthday and were in need of cupcakes for a school celebration. Forgot to mention I also had a 2 week old baby boy at the time so making them myself just wasn’t an option. I looked on Postmates and came across Big Sugar Bakeshop and of course read their google & yelp reviews and decided to give them a try. I called the bakery before placing my order to make sure they could fulfill it in the amount of time I needed it by. They were so helpful, very kind and I was beyond satisfied!!! There was no cupcake left behind as you often see at kids birthdays (most of the time half eaten) their plates were clean! The teacher was even commenting on how delicious they were so of course I had to try one myself (I hadn’t been having sweets since I developed gestational diabetes during my pregnancy). Holy MOLY it was so moist, the perfect sweetness ( not too sweet), amazing flavor... I think it has to be the best cupcake I’ve ever had!!! I ordered the birthday party cupcakes. Now they are my go to bakery whenever I need to take a sweet little surprise to friends houses for dessert, as thank you’s, parties, anything I’m already trying to think of an excuse to order them again. I don’t think I’ll bake another cupcake myself as long as I live close by bc nothing will be as good as their delicious cupcakes. I’m excited to try their cakes next.</Review>

<review>There's really only one thing you need to buy at Big Sugar: the caramel sea-salt brownies. Arguably the best dessert in the store, you can try their many other goodies, but you'd be selling yourself short if you go home without these gooey chocolatey-good delights.

The prices are reasonable for high-end baked goods and the staff are lovely.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating><user_id>112267550950772892397</user_id><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2bdfcbcdecce1:0x768a6ba3157b5373< /gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

<Date>1485230426878<//Date><Rate>3</Rate><text>Is used to love this place. LOVE LOVE LOVE it! But lately I've noticed a decline in quality from the studio city location. We ordered two dozen mixed cupcakes and repeatedly explained that they needed to be but free because our daughter's school doesn't allow nuts. My husband brought home the three leftover cupcakes and I nearly died. German chocolate cake, pistachio and a carrot cake with a huge but on top. OMG. A child could have died! The kid with the worst nut allergies was mercifully absent that day. But the carrot cake was frighteningly sweet. The last two times I've gotten chocolate chip doughnut muffins the bottoms have been wet and they've been bulky and dense. These used to be incredible. I don't know if there's been a staff change or what but it's been a bumpy ride lately. I'm not quite ready to give up but I'm no longer craving anything from there.  Also a recent quote for a birthday party. . .   Cupcakes with fondant - $7 each. What?!? Absurd.

Note - had a really lovely email from Big Sugar Bakeshop saying they'd look into this.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

This place beats Sprinkles and that Suziecakes place handsdown!
I mean, it's not even a contest.
And I'm not hating on the others, it's just....the Vegan Chocolate cupcake
alone could beat out the best of the cupcakes in those other joints.</review>

Bring it on Diabetes

For all you sweet tooth addicts, this is your spot.  The name doesn't lie, this bake shop had some mega Big Sugar associated with their bakes everything from donuts, muffins, scones, cupcakes, brownies, pies, ice cream sandwiches, banana puddings, cake, cake pops, everything short of a cake made of all icing them topped with macarons made of pure sugar then finished off with sweet condensed milk drizzled all over it.

Caffeine itch

The reason I come is actually for the fresh brewed cup of joe or their iced lattes on the way to work.  They also sell bottles of Ground Works Cold Brews that are organic.  Only thing is it's hard to find and there's almost no parking around the area.  The bake shop literally has to give out free cookies on the corner to make people aware of their presence.

Good thing for me...I'm addicted to free cookies.  Some would say I have a problem.</Review>

after reading the reviews I was excited to try. I had Postmates deliver.
It was very disappointing. Not like Sprinkles as a few describe in reviews. The 2 cupcakes I tried were close to completely stale & dry. The icing tasted fine on the birthday party cupcake & it wasn't too thick with icing. The whip cream in the Icebox cupcake was good, but the cake was not; dry & stale. Possibly, being close to closing time they sent my Postmates away with old treats.
The Oreo brownie was terrible & oatmeal cookie unedible.

Not worth the calories trying all of this. I'll save my calories for Sprinkles. I've never had a dry or stale cupcake there. Most likely since they move so much product it never sits.
Sorry, I would not try again.</Text>

I usually go for their freshly battered fish and chips which are well portioned and always piping hot; some of the best I’ve ever had! Their burgers are also fresh and tasty.

The owners are really kind and I always recommend stopping by after work for a six pack and some good local food.< /review>< Response>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I've been here several times so far because I like it. It's a friendly neighborhood market with a kitchen to serve a well-sized menu of delights. The place is friendly and yet very down-to-earth style of simplicity and you can enjoy sports on the TV and/or play the lottery until you drop. Just help yourself is pretty much the mantra here, but the food is totally awesome!

I like the burgers the best! They are cooked on the open flame grill and you can have just about anything you want. The fries are large and just right. I've had the reuben sandwich but it needs to be re-thought about because it did not have enough meat. The bread should be toasted as well. The meat and cheese should be oven melted before placing on the bread. I like it the old-fashioned way, but it was still very good, but it needs improvement. The fish'N chips are very good if that's what you like. Generous portions and you won't be disappointed. I certainly do go out of my way to get here to have some good food, company, and also not the hassles of too many people around. You'll be glad you came.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-rz9cL8bCK4kAdtUS2_P9jDWA8Va_-uQJsLNx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoPY_VXo6bPpaR-nRZnPomM_uw2EXYSyHaaOXA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeBrKGG9I-MQFbjOYzom-CBHb0YaF2CLdC9kfw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCgTMPI3eYWlyDzGtEW3ugPBPdESdxwHetXzMw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvKCU0W0sZorERUHEiyvAfYZ2XW0dncaOVKhp7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSr3zl8sWNcpFnwxM9yd4cFXB77Z1HLn4Ie1Is=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOypvVmsJoi1ku8VpZkAiwiVfEkvvxtiFtp_ABV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

Just turned in a Powerball ticket with 3 winning standard numbers. Thought I'd end up with 7 bucks.  Was told that the payout is $5. Ok, fine.
I get home and check. There is no such payout for either the Powerball or the Megamillions (in case I was mistaken about the ticket type). It's either $7 or $10 dollars.
There's nothing I hate more than dishonesty. Watch your wallet at this register.< /review>

Great food and kind owner holding down the family business started by his Pops in 74. Every dish i've had here had good portions & flavors. I hope to see their restaraunt survive thru covid & beyond. Support old Frisco mom n pop spots. OneLove</text>

<text>I ordered the lamb kebob - tasty but not what I expected (mediterranean kebob). I also like that it came with a big portion of avocado too. If I in the area again, I would get that again or try their other offerings.</text>< pictures>

Very friendly and fast service. The place if unpretentious and true to a small neighborhood place to get good straight forward food. I got the fish and chips which were perfectly done
and a very generous serving. I would eat there again. If your looking for a great place to get a good place and your at the Chase Center AT&T on in the Potero Hill area stop by. Reasonable priced tasty and well prepared.<//Review>

Is what it is. No fuss. Burgers. Fries. Sandwiches. Includes vegetarian options and turkey options. Grab a drink from the fridge. Sit and watch the TV or just come scarf on a lunch break. Convenient location for me and I like no fuss. Staff is super friendly. Thanks.</text>

<text>They have an ok burger it’s good for the price in the city. Today didn’t go well considering whoever was working the phone couldn’t relay to me that they were doing only cash today. If he would have informed me on the phone it could have have been a non issue but he waited till I got there to tell me the situation of cash only. He ended up wasting my time as well as their food and time. won’t be back<//text><userid>104631120564658962684<//userid>< resp>

The food is good but the company is better. The owner is really charismatic and the cooking staff is friendly. My go to is their California Chicken burrito and I'm never disappointed. Their salmon salad has that nice homemade touch and feel that makes it even better.<//Text>

<Text>No frills burger and fries, along with an odd assortment of kebabs, fish and chips, burritos made with said fries...

If you want the modern expression of healthy food, this is not for you.  On the other hand, everything tastes great for a reasonable price.  If you go in at lunch,. The crowd is mostly blue collar there for a hearty meal.

The fish and chips and burgers are both very good, have mostly stock with those and been happy.</Text>< Pictures>

Bare bones, great burger. Cpl Tv's to watch the game
Nice staff. Super cheap eats n beers from self help fridges. The rest room may need a sense of humor. Buy a lottery ticket or play the tv game. Kinda like kino. This was a whole back. Guess I didn't hit post. Still great burgers n fish n chips. Check out their wine u wont believe their prices. Look closely.< /text>

I love this place. Awesome burger with fries. Totally unpretentious and fairly affordable. A bit of a hike up a hill to get here but absolutely worth it. They have a hilarious number of different products available in such a small space (burgers, drinks from cooler, lottery, postage services). Have the heartwarming charm of a mom & pop shop.</text></record>

Best Burgers on the hill...possibly in SF. Staff is friendly and setting is basic...Ina good way. No pretension, just great food, sports TV on in background and juicy rich flavorful burgers. Eat here every week and am never let down.</review>

<Review>Love coming here frequently because the owners are always friendly and kind. I have had their best burgers, fish and chips, and just last night had their chicken salad. Delicious. It had pineapple pieces that gave it a citrus taste, avocado, fresh cut lettuce and more. The chicken was grilled. Great service. A great place to eat, too when you're on your way to either the Giants or 49er game (well at least for this football season in the city). They do have a TV.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This place makes amazing burgers!  I go to San Francisco every summer and this is the first and last place I go to eat every time.  The burgers are gigantic and incredibly cheap.  Oh and fries don't cost you extra.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
WOW, just WOW. I'm returning from my Yelp hiatus to write this review. So much so that I'm writing this after having taken just one bite of their Surf & Turf and inhaling a chicken wing in mere seconds.

I ordered through Amazon's Prime Now, and wanted to try something outside of my normal neighborhood food delivery cuisines of Chinese & Thai. Ganim's clearly did not disappoint. Quick delivery, ~ 1hr after I ordered.

Go with the Surf & Turf. Get chicken wings too. Don't think about the macros. Just do it.

Back to enjoying my meal now. Thanks Ganim's!< /Review>

Have you ever had a cheeseburger in a liquor store? You probably should. Don't worry, it's really quite tasty, and amazingly cheap.<//Review>

The best burger on the hill, and yes possibly SF. If you haven't tried Gamin's you should, on your way in or out of town, you won't be disappointed.< /text>

Parking is a bit of a walk from the spot, but it took me less than 30 seconds to drop off my return and leave. Super clean location with helpful staff.< /text>

Tried it once because all others seemed to be full, and oh my goodness. Can't drive or park near it.  Spent so long looking for parking within walking distance that it would have been better for my time and fossil fuel usage to drive to Sacramento locker instead.

If you're a student or live within walking distance I am sure it's fine.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Yes the it is clean but this is the most inconvenient hub in the world.   You have to pay for parking and it’s two block from there.  If you are a current UC student it is great but  for the public, it’s a hassle.  To top it off, they will not let you in the hub unless you complete a COVID daily online survey prior to your arrival. The door gate keeper said, “ I’ll take your  return today, but I need a survey next time”.  Next time like never.< /Text>

I was expecting LIVE caterpillars which need to be opened asap.  They sat at ship/receiving in a roomful of undelivered packages and never notified anyone.  Neither the Hub+ or Amazon knew where the package was for a week.  I was told it was returned because of no faculty/dept name on package, but days later found out it was in 'the room'.< /text>< pics>

Deduct 1 star for parking. Went here on a Saturday afternoon. Signage a bit confusing where to park. Ended up parking behind the tennis courts. Found the drop off point easily and was on my way out. Just be prepared to have prepared package ready to drop so you don't spend too much time there being how I found out I didn't have the proper parking permit. Didn't get cited!< /Review>

Everything you need is inside. You dont have to print out your return recipts, you can print the return recipt from the kiosk as a sticker. Super convenient. Friendly and helpful staff as well.< /Review>

You have to print your own return ticket from a kiosk but otherwise the service was excelent. Out of 2 packages that I had to carry accros campus only one could be returned there (bad luck would have it it was the lighter one) so wish i could return everything in one place instead of having to go and drop stuff off at the UPS store as well.< /text>

Ridiculously hard to get to for non-students who just need to return an Amazon package. A complete hassle.  The bike riders add to the stress somewhat because there a multitude of them and they are all over. One has to be extra careful not to hit one of them.  I would try to avoid this whole hassle as best possible.< /text>

If you are parking, the best place to park is North Entry parking structure on Howard Way (Map it). Make sure to bring some quarters for the meter. Short walk south to the Amazon drop off.< /Text>

Came within the opening hours, 6 pm. The store was open but nobody was at the counter. I tried calling for assistance into the storage hatch but no one answered. I've waited for over fifteen minutes and no one showed. Finally I gave up and went home empty-handed.< /Review>

I go here every week with my kids, because they give really good haircuts, the prices are just right not over expensive as other places. Everybody in there is extremely gifted as a barber. If there are any issues with how your hair looks they will take really good care of you. Highly recommended for military and civilians.</Review>

Carmen has been cutting my hair for about two years now, she always gives great haircuts, whatever style you ask for she will do! Best straight razor fades I can find in the area for price. She’s always very professional and welcoming when I’m there, I will continue to give her my business!< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>The absolute sweetest woman in Oceanside, I really recommend this barbershop, I’ve been living in Oceanside for about 3 years now and I have yet to find someone so consistent with haircuts like carmines, so I havnt bothered looking for any other shops because carmines does above and beyond. I’m super grateful I found this little spot, it’s in a great location, and it’s super easy to find parking. If I could have rated it 6/5 stars, I definitely would have.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I go here every week not out of loyalty but because they give good haircuts, it's NOT always super crowded and the prices are just right. Carmen is very serious about the quality of haircuts. If there are any issues you just hafto tell her and she will resolve them. recommended for military and civilians.< /Review>

It was hard finding a good place to get haircut especially during this pandemic. Then I struck to this place, it sure is a hidden gem. Carmen is best what she does and I hope everyone would see that. She’s professional, keep things clean, and does a great job! I will definitely be back and would recommend her to anyone!</text>

I’ve been coming to Carmen’s for over a year now and I’ve enjoyed her services immensely.
When I get my cut, I know I’m going to get a consistent, qualitative experience.

What I appreciate the most is that she takes care to be as specific about the style that you request.
She always takes the time to get everything the way you want it. I like this attention to detail.

Her establishment is clean, her bathroom is roomy and she has an ATM to accommodate your payment needs.

Her prices are competitive with others and I always appreciate the conversation.

Do not recommend this place, my siblings went over there and it was the worst experience they've had to just get a freaking hair cut. Do not recommend at all!!! My little brother doesn't even want to go back to this place!!!

Hair cut was good, Experience/service was BAD, AWFUL, and UNPROFESSIONAL.</review>

This barber shop is honestly offers the best hair cuts! We had been visiting in San Diego and my husband needed to get a fade. Not only were prices reasonable but they did a wonderful job! I also was able to get my haircut so they do offer girl haircuts! They can get busy on the weekend but they do take appointments within the week! Thanks Carmen for your wonderful customer service if ever in the area again would come again</text>

I got a great haircut from Carmen yesterday. I am a woman, and it's hard to get a good short cut. Carmen listened carefully to what I said, and she delivered. The cut is feminine and lays down perfectly. The price was reasonable, and I got an appointment quickly. I'll be back!</Review>

Carmen has always done a great job keeping a nice clean environment. I have been coming here for over 2 years, hair cuts every weak, and she never disappoints me. Her fades and trims are on point.
Highly recommend this barbershop.</Text>

(Translated by Google) It is the best barbershop. I can always trust Carmen. It's consistent, takes its time, and has good prices.

<text>Purchased items at Macy's using Christmas gift cards and discovered later that clerk kept my gift card that still had balance left over. It wasn't a mistake on her part as she said I needed to pay an additional 10 cents to cover rest of balance due. Buyer beware always check your receipt when still at register to make sure you aren't cheated.
Returned to the store and explained what happened and macy's gave me a gift card for missing balance,  great customer service.<//text>< Pics>

The mall closed while we were at a restaurant in the mall. So we had to walk all the way around the outside of the mall and up a stairway to get back to our car.</Review>

<Review>I remember when "Plaza Camino Real" (PCR) was in the concept stage. Originally, it was planned to be built North of Hwy 78. (Where Gemco/Target is currently.) The O'side/C'bad City business owners decided to create a large scale "mall" to centrally locate most all the businesses in Carlsbad and Oceanside. Only, this had NEVER been attempted before, anywhere. They didn't know if this grand experiment was going to be a success, or fall flat on it's face. Yes, this is the very first mall of it's size to be attempted. Now, you may ask," Why is it in Carlsbad, and not Oceanside?" Well, it had to boil down to parking space fees. Since this was an experiment, they didn't know if it would work, or not. Because of this, the City of Oceanside demanded $9 per parking space, per year. (Multiplied by thousands of spaces, this became some real money.)
Well, Carlsbad heard about the shenanigans the Oceanside City tried to pull, and made "PCR" an offer of $3 per space, for the first 10 years. Needless to say, they jumped at the opportunity that Carlsbad had offered. Back in 1970, when this mall opened, it drew shoppers from ACROSS THE COUNTRY to shop there. It was a very popular place to see, and BE SEEN.
Needless to say, it became a huge success (until Amazon killed retail brick & mortar establishments.)
Anyhow, since other businesses saw the success of PCR, the auto dealerships did the same thing. That's how "Car Country" was born...

And now you know, the rest of the story...</Review>< pictures>

Good for teen girls.  I have no real use for the mall right now, only about 20 stores open. The popular stores only allow certain amount of shoppers.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Another Mall, but very clean.  Well kept and maintained.  Floors and decor is on point for the area. Great kids section.  Plenty of shops to make those $1,000 dollar purchases.  Or just relax and unwind.  Plenty of places to eat.  Huge variety of foods. Plus a big plus.

<Review>The Escalator going up to second floor was not working. My friend in her 80s and I'm in late seventies. We had a very hard time climbing up.  The elevator was also not working.  When we were ready to come down to first floor, the Escalator moving to go down was moving too fast and unable to use it.  We walked down the Escalator which was out. People who wanted to come up, had to wait until we reached main floor.  All of this was so tiring.  Why isn't it fixed or repaired? Macy's is a large pricey store that is making shopping unbearable, especially for Seniors.  We won't return if this is going to be a lengthy problem<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dc71890ff40c13:0x61f48bacf713a5ee</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>One of the best Zara stores that I've been to. It's very clean and well maintained. Also if your going to be a rude customer expect them to treat you the same it's not okay to think they'll treat you with excellent customer service if you're not kind.< /Review>< pictures>

One of my favorite places to go shopping at is at the Macy’s Department Store. Macy’s has great deals on their women’s clothing.

I bought (4) Clothing items. The Style & Company
Sport Tahiti Pink with a Velour Jacket and the Pants
in the Black Velour Set for the total amount of $40.00. Then I bought this Karen Scott Printed Cotton Shirt on Sale for $18.00 and the Karen Scott Fleece in the color
(New Amore Red) ZIP-UP Jacket on sale for $15.00.

Macy’s customer service is excellent!<//text>

There's a lot of great shopping here. Fresh and new and aesthetically pleasing.  Took my daughter and her husband to Cheese Cake Factory in the mall. It was a long wait but the food was worth it.  There were some other cool looking restaurants in the mall that I'd like to try next time.<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>really big mall. the mall is really well lit and extremely clean and well maintained. the employees are extremely nice in every store. I always saw workers in the mall cleaning up and emptying trash cans. the bathroom were really big but, occasionally were full because I went during black Friday. the day I went it was raining and when I entered in there was a very long non slip mat to wipe off shoes and a rack with umbrella bags. really nice touch!</Text>< pictures>

Very clean, great shops and excellent customer service. Went inside Macy's, tried so many different dresses for special occasion and customer service was excellent. Couple of workers looking for items for me to try on... I left with what I was looking for! Very delighted and grateful! Will definitely come again!</Review>

< Review>
I used to hang out here a lot before covid but now it has a more or less uneasy feeling. The uneasy feeling came about after it reopened. Idk if it the people or the music but something is a little odd right now. I would've rated it 5 stars if it wasn't weird when it reopened. Weird being the fact that the music was changed up to a different genre. Uneasy because of the fact I think the mall is actually like a hang out spot with there few stores open really. people walking around for no reason. Won't be coming back soon.

How are they paying to keeping the electricity up is what I'm wondering.

Best time of the year to go shopping. This place has gotten better but still needs more stores to open. Has a potential to be a go to mall here in carlsbad.</Text>

Staff all seemed pretty friendly and helpful. There were good Black Friday sales and stores that I enjoyed.
Cons; no affordable food options besides smoothies and pretzels. JCPenney store was a messy disaster including the restroom.<//text>

<Text>The new renovations are really nice but a lot of the shops I came here for are gone. So it’s kind of boring now. Cinnabon is gone so is Mcdonalds. And there’s no Froyo. It just feels like a boring upscale mall now. The kids love the new playground though.</Text>< Pics>

Oh my goodness! I've grown up in Carlsbad my whole life and the mall was a big part of my life. I truly wish they would have renovated sooner. There is so much to do at this mall now everything from Dave & Busters to The Cheesecake Factory to the movie theater all the shops that you can go shopping at and more including a 24-hour fitness. I'm very impressed with the developers and what they've done with this Shopping Center! Well done!< /Text>

Okay people, it's official, they fixed the seats at Regal. 😁 New comfortable recliners in the theater. In the past month I've watched It: Chapter Two, Abominable,  Good Boys & Ad Astra. Each
theater/screen had new seats. 😉 Not to mention all the places to eat. Wokcano, Pizza Press, Cheesecake Factory, and much more.< /text>

It's cool there are lots of Shoppes, eateries and the movie theater. Parking is sometimes a hassle but other than that pretty much have every story you can think of and good restaurants like the Yard House, Luna Grill, Islands and others. Only gave it four stars because just the parking is an issue<//Text>

<Review>They did an outstanding job on renovating this mall. Once old and run down mall to a beach vibe feel to it type of mall.
Great restaurants to chose from. Island, Cheesecake Factory, Yard House not to mention all the others like Pizza Press and Wacano.
Check out there H&M, Forever 21 and Zara. Yes, there are still are open spaces throughout the mall but, overall its clean, beachy and retail staff very helpful.
Outside of the mall you'll find fire pits, comfy lounge seats, outlets to charge your phone and just overall great mall.
Come shop here...<//Review>< Pictures>

<user>116998188260233733484</user><text>High vacancy rate, interesting businesses close quickly due to high rent and low foot traffic while maintaining other locations. Sears will be another vacancy (finally being put out of its misery 12/2019).  Lots of plywood walls hiding vacant areas.

Their biggest additions face the outside and have no access from the inside.

Horrible configuration, seems like poor management.  From what I heard, Westfield didn't improve the site because of Carlsbad's meddling and city-owned parking lot issues.

I tried to drive up to check it out after seeing a bunch of new store  announcements from December of 2018... As of September 2019, most have already closed or never opened!

No hope of Trader Joe's going there or anything else that's a genuine draw. One business that was related to a horrible scandal ripping off military men is still there.  Horrible impression to take a family and see inappropriately-dressed women selling "jewelry."<//text><Time>1569383864128< /Time>< Name>

<review>There is so much to do at this mall now everything from Dave & Busters to The Cheesecake Factory to the movie theater all the shops that you can go shopping at and more including a 24-hour fitness. I'm very impressed with the developers and what they've done with this Shopping Center! Well done!< /review>< Gmap_id>

But then competition is the beautiful beach in Carlsbad on a sunny day. Great shops, food, Dave & Buster's, Regal Theaters. Macy's and JC Penney's too.
I didn't know they still existed as stores.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>It's beautiful.  They have a great variety and deals.  There's some major franchises to choose from like Starbucks, Rubio's and Johnny Rockets.  I love the Gap store here, it's huge and pretty organized considering how busy they get!  This is one of my to go shopping outlets with my family.</text>< pics>

The remodel has ended.  They really fixed up this old mall.  The place is completely different, new, modern and new shops and restaurants.  Cheesecake factory is my choice.  One slice of that delicious cheesecake , but which one do you get?  I took the girlfriend to dinner there, the food was great and we ate on the outside patio, so the entertainment was free.  People watching at the mall.  Oh ok that another review on it's own.</text>

The internet is useless here. I came in to try and buy a coffee and log in to my online class (like I can at any coffee shop anywhere these days) and after connecting to their "free wifi" my computer had no internet access at all. Complete waste of time.< /Review>

Great place to hang out. It’s really coming back to life. Glad to see them resurrecting this mall instead of letting it die like so many malls these days. Great dining options, a brand new theater and a few good stores. Once they get some more shopping in there this place will really be rounded out.</review>

This place is so different than it used to be. I almost got lost when I was wondering around. It doesn't look as big as it truly is on the outside. Definitely doesn't have that almost sketchy vibe that it used too. They have a good variety of stores. If a family of 5 visited there would be something for everyone. It was very clean and the kiosk people weren't as aggressive as they usually are in malls. I'd recommend to anyone who likes people watching too, there's almost always some weirdo to stare at hehehe</text>

<review>The newly remodeled mall has alot of new stores to check out. It was a rainy day and being an enclosed mall made it a good choice for casual shopping. Fun day lots of good deals.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The shops at Carlsbad? More like the shops of Oceanside. This mall is not in a great neighborhood, and doesn’t have the wealth around it like other malls do. Yet they put over priced store, and over priced dinning inside in hopes to get that Carlsbad feel. The mall has been under construction for YEARS, and still isn’t finished. There are tons of shops that are either empty or still needing of renovation. Many of the stores that were once at this mall are all gone. Why? Because of over priced rent that can no longer be paid by small shops. Zara, H&M and many other stores have stated that they don’t want booths set up outside of their stores or in the middle of the mall. While I agree with this, it’s ludicrous to have empty space in the middle of your mall. At least put some plants, benches or anything more then the nothing that’s there currently. Lastly, the mall has gone from fun and over priced, to greedy, expensive, and underwhelming as a whole. Half the mall is “new” and half is still “old”. It’s been nearly a 5 year renovation and this is what you have to show?!?!? If you want a real mall in Carlsbad, go to the Outlets in Carlsbad.< /Text>

<text>More than half the mall is empty. So, if you are there to shop, you will most likely be disappointed. However, there are a good number of higher end restaurants there and more are coming in. Maybe this will become a hot restaurant stop in the future. This is also a great indoor place to walk if you need to get some steps in.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Malls all over are dying and this one seems to be no different.  Half the stores are closed down. Bathrooms are disgusting. Its fine if you need something from a mall setting I suppose but I would much rather shop anywhere else.<//Review>< name>

Good selection of stores and much nicer since they finished all the construction.  Great addition of The Cheesecake Factory, although way too small considering there is not call ahead seating.

One question though, why is it that 24/7 fitness is located in this mall.  I think its kinda funny, but, of course, that is just me.< /Text>

Would have loved to check out the stores, however, I got a headache from the horrible cologne/scent that is being used to lure you to spend money.  Tried twice and had to get out fast.  Such a pity.< /review>

Hands down the best poke place in town.   We've tried them all.  This place is bonkers.  Best sauces.  They don't skimp on the fish or toppings.  So glad it opened up.  We'll be here at least once a week.</Text>

<Text>This post is for Dave and busters. I went on a Saturday, waited in the bar and was never acknowledged by a cocktail waitress or the bar. Then a waiter named Sam asked us if we needed help, so we sat with him. He was well trained on the menu and the play deals. Not only did he give us amazing service, but the food was super good. Because of him I will come back, don't be afraid to request him. It's worth it. Too many people hold food service positions and suck a$$. He saved this place from a bad review. I will visit again. Sundays during the game has awesome food and drink specials.< /Text>< pics>

The Shoppes at Carlsbad has always been really nice. Currently they are going through a really big remodeling so its not as nice as it usually is currently. They still have stores open that you can go too. Namely the movie theater and Dave and Busters. I was recently at Dave and Busters and it is AWESOME!<//review>

Great selection of stores, love the food here - Ruby's Diner has a nice cost to portion ratio which is always important to me wherever I go.

There are always deals on clothes here. Pretty sure there's a 50% off sale at Reebok at the time of my review!< /Text>

<Review>We continued to shop here through the renovations, which were downright eerie! But as things get put back together, It is lovely. Esp enjoy some of the bright, appealing colors, which can be seen outside. New places to eat, but mostly sit-down, which we don't always have time for. Other than the pretzel place, there is nowhere quick to grab a bite. New stores, much welcomed. Prefer going to the mall in Escondido, with its tremendous variety and large food court, but it's too far from me.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>Last of the dieing malls. It's a great location to walk and kill time. But there are so many vacant stores. And the stores that are left are expensive. Just to make rent. If you come here looking for a food court don't. Because only big restaurants and little wetzle pretzles. I still come here to get rings sized. And Comics and Stuff. Seems to be a ghost town during the week.<//Text>< UserId.>

No food court for such a large shopping mall, and lack of bathroom facilities in general seems strange in a 21st Century major metropolis. Easiest way to use a restroom is to go to something like Macy's or Sears or something and ask there. There is, however, a great comics/games store in the mall which is why I return. The cinema there is good too with big comfy recliners.< /Text>

< Review>
There have been some significant improvements to this mall since the olden days of Westfield (ugh), and the improvements keep on coming. Plenty of quality restaurants and shops to choose from, including a huge comic store! There are still some empty areas that should hopefully be filled up as time goes on. A warning, though: don't go to Cheesecake Factory, the service there is notoriously bad. Yard House is a much safer and more pleasant option.</Review>

There are many Shoppes here that fit any style and any person. The price range varies from both cheap to affordable for certain items but not luxury items. The mall offers an abundance amount of choices of food at varying prices but are usually crowded at night. Because the mall is still in construction there is a lack of Shoppes compared to other malls.< /review>

They’ve definitely started improving the mall, bust it’s still sort of empty and very quiet. I think it’ll be much better when more stores are added as well as more food options. Not a bad place to go to kill some time or if you need something at Sears, Macy’s or jc penny’s.< /text>

Most of the stores were having fantastic sales, making it a wonderful time to shop!  Bath and Body Works is one of my favorite places that I took advantage of their specials.  Macy's had incredible deals as well!  The customer service at both, Bath and Body Works and Macy's, was very friendly and outstanding!< /Review>

<review>I really like this mall! It's modern, clean, spacious... it doesn't have sp many people that it's over crowded and there are stores with prices for every budget. They have the site's you expect to see at the mall; Macy's, JCPenny, Sears, Victoria's Secret, etc and stores that I was pleasantly surprised to find, like Payless Shoes Source and even a dollar store. The only downfall is theres only one area with restrooms (aside from the various stores that will allow customers to use the bathroom) and there's only one elevator, so if you are pushing your littles in a stroller and need to switch floors you typically have to walk out of your way to do it. The elevators and bathrooms are close to each other, located in the center of the mall.< /review>< Rating>

<Review>Construction is coming along. Great new restaurants, but parking is a bit of a pain as most of the new restaurants are near the theater where parking is limited. Interior is looking great. The department stores are still very dated and slim pickings, but they work in a pinch if we are on a time crunch. If you are looking for a great mall experience and u are in North County then go to North County Fair in Escondido or up to The Promenade (the best) in Temecula (only about 25 minutes from Oceanside).<//Review>< gmapID>

<Review>Renovations are still going on at this Mall so there's still a lot of empty shops here. The Macys is just OK, the Sears & Penny's stores are old and dumpy. I go here for the nice high end Regal theater where assigned leather  seats recline & they serve wine and beer. Also like the new trendy Yard House Restaurant.<//Review><user>115927881650072980324<//user><date>1519706882922< /date></record>

They have really done a good job with the renovation. Malls in America are on the decline. However, The Shoppes at Carlsbad is on the rise. The addition of new restaurants has made this the place to be. I went on a Saturday night and the parking lot was packed. The restaurants were full with waits and the movie I saw was sold out. Good job to the new management company of this mall. This was needed.<//text>

Crowded mall with a crazy parking lot. Want to turn left when everyone else is heading right? Plan on waiting 10 minutes to turn. The day I went there there was some silly marathon so that didn't help. Inside I wanted to go to the second floor but the escalator was broken. Maybe management needs to step up a bit and address the ridiculous parking lot and broken elevators? There is a good selection of restaurants here such as Dave & Buster's, The Yardouse, Islands Restaurant etc. Some of them  can only be accessed from the outside of the mall as they are on the outside. Good luck figuring all that out with minimal signage telling you where to go. Do I hear a new business case for The Harvard Business School on how not to plan a mall?</text>

The upgrades and new additions of stores and places to eat really make this place feel trendy. After 10+ years of a sad excuse for a mall, the remodel has revitalized the whole area of Carlsbad. There are numerous places to eat, hangout and a nice play area for the kids. I can't wait till everything is open, this place will be poppin'.<//Review>

Pardon the dust, this mall is getting a HUGE renovation.  Clean interior despite the work being done outside.  Lots of new stores replacing the old guard, parking is good, and looking forward to all the new stores soon to fill in all the empty spots.</Review>

Lots more coming after construction is completed. Looking forward to Cheesecake Factory & Yard House. Used to not be the best of malls but things have really changed, with more to come. Regal cinemas is great, way better value than Cinepolis.< /Review>

<review>The owners of this complex helped fund a "grassroots" smear campaign to torpedo what would have been a world class shopping and entertainment center on Canon Rd by the freeway.  Instead, we get a weed riddled rat nest with no development and tax payers have to foot the bill for mosquito abatement and preservation of the Aqua Hedionda lagoon which the developer we scared away had offered to pay for in perpetuity.  Greedy business interests and ignorant crusaders who thought they were doing good cost us significantly.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp><username>Han Solo</username>< userid>

The mall is still a work in progress. That being said, the part of the mall that has been reconstructed is well designed, adding fantastic opportunites for social gathering, eating and entertainment. When the reconstruction and redesign is complete this mall will earn five stars.< /text>

Now that all the renovations are nearly complete this had transformed into a beautiful mall. There are a lot of good places to eat, and the shopping center has a lot to offer. I'm sure once they fill up the vacancies in the mall it will be the first to place in Carlsbad.<//Review>

Carlsbad mall, two levels, still under some remodeling,  has a brighter appearance and plenty of shopping, including Sears, Macy's, JC Penney's, Regal-12 cinema, and places to eat. Plenty of free parking, but holiday shopping crowds can make finding a good spot challenging.</review>

So where the hell are all the stores at???  This mall only has JC Penney the cinemas and some Restaurants but alot of empty space inside. A Mall with out Lids or Hatworld? What kind of Mall is that! The Mall finished it's remodel over a year ago and it now has fewer stores. People that live in the area go to the Outlets instead or drive out to Escondido to visit a real mall.< /Review>

Lot's of improvements in an effort to bring this mall into the 21st Century.  Very clever and thoughtful approach to creating dining options on the exterior and interior of the mall.  Nice play area near J.C. Pennys for children, Macy's is doing lots of new improvements and they have added several interesting new small stores.  Malls will never be what they used to be but I think this one is making headway.  4 stars because it has a way to go.  I spend time at the movie theater here, Cheesecake Factory and shopping at Macy's.  Convenient, pleasant and safe.  A great place to get your 10,000 steps in for the day in an air conditioned environment this Summer.   Can''t wait to see what they do next.  Keep working on it!< /review>

Currently under renovation. The mall is still open. Can't wait for new stores and restaurants. They say renovations will take about a year. Still lots of parking  and great stores to go shopping.< /text>

<Review>Newly renovated, looks great. Kids play area is a big hit. New shops like H&M, Zara,  Francesca's, and new restaurant openings like Cheesecake Factory, Islands, Yardhouse make this mall a great upgrade for coastal North county.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Overall, this is a small mall. However, there are several good stores and food vendors located here. There is a Dave and Busters, which is a popular arcade for adults and children alike. There are the typical U.S. brand stores like Hollister, Spencer's, Macys, JCPenney, Victoria's Secret and many others as well as a nice comic shop. Even an adjoined Regal movie theater. While, like I said, this is honestly a pretty small mall, they have packed quite a bit of goodness into the space and it has a nice overall feel to it. I like this location .</Review>< Name>

I would give it 5 stars if there was a nice, real coffee shop in there, not just basically a coffee stand on the 2nd floor (btw, their latte sucks). Hopefully with all of the new and wonderful improvements we will have one soon. The mall looks absolutely amazing after the renovation (which is still ongoing). My daughter loves the new playground and I love all of the new stores like Zara, H&M, Pandora.<//Text>

This mall is undergoing a big remodel. On the south side of the mall there is a big movie theater and a couple nice restaurants. A month or two ago there was a Peet's Coffee but recently they disappeared.<//Review>

Aging shopping mall with several vacancies and independent retailers no one has ever heard of. It looks as if there is an effort being made to save the Mall with some investment in upgrades. Let's hope so.< /text>

A very good place to shop with the whole family.  Lots of shops guarantee interest from every member of the family.  Great food in many little restaurants that have niche type foods or very familiar types also.  If you're shopping with family members I think it personally should be a hit for every family. If you haven't given me the try you should the people are Pleasant at the stores and there's a wide selection of things you can get there clothing sunglasses shoes skateboards baby items suits furniture toys decorations and many more selections then I mentioned. Not far from here are Toyota Ford Chevy Jeep Nissan and used car dealerships as well as the new. You also have the Carlsbad flower fields right next door as well. An easy spot to go to from the beach if you need a break from the Sun take one here.< /review>

Great mall for the Oceanside area. I used to live in the area for years until I moved to Riverside County. I still come up in the area. This place is not ghetto. Better than L.A.< /text>

Aging shopping mall with several vacancies and independent retailers no one has ever heard of. It looks as if there is an effort being made to save the Mall with some investment in upgrades. Let's hope so.<//Review>

They have had much construction and this has really brought the mall down. Interest in the mall decreased and so there are less shops and less fun. Used to love this place but now its boring.<//review>

<text>A very good place to shop with the whole family.  Lots of shops guarantee interest from every member of the family.  Great food in many little restaurants that have niche type foods or very familiar types also.  If you're shopping with family members I think it personally should be a hit for every family. If you haven't given me the try you should the people are Pleasant at the stores and there's a wide selection of things you can get there clothing sunglasses shoes skateboards baby items suits furniture toys decorations and many more selections then I mentioned. Not far from here are Toyota Ford Chevy Jeep Nissan and used car dealerships as well as the new. You also have the Carlsbad flower fields right next door as well. An easy spot to go to from the beach if you need a break from the Sun take one here.</text>< pictures>

<text>Definitely looking more modern with the recent facelift and new restaurants opening on the East end of the mall. Still have the classic department stores (JC Penney, Macy's, and Sears) holding it all together, but it seems like the "writing is on the wall" for these century-old giants, especially Sears which is still clinging to life on the West end of the mall (complete with an Auto center!). Will be interesting to see what the future holds, although what is a mall without department stores?</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dc71890ff40c13:0x61f48bacf713a5ee<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This mall has really been improved between tne new restaurants (yard house and cheesecake factory to name a few), from the revamped interior its definitely a great place to shop. The major area for improvement would be parking. The parking is absoulutly terrible maybe with all of the added foot traffic someone can get the idea to invest into a parking structure.< /review>

Both the Luna & Panara have beautiful outdoor seating. Laser tag and my kiddos say a pretty good at arcade area. All the same shops as most indoor malls as this was a Westfield previously but The Shoppes have made amazing improvement, great mall staff & security so I'm comfortable with my older teens shopping with their tween sister outside my immediate view. They still have plans & parts are still going to go under updates to modernization of the indoor, outdoor as well as building  upward within the next few years. Also great toddler play area, trains within the mall, a beautifully maintained merry-go-round🎠< /Text>< Time>

The special rolls are very delicious, sushi and sashimi are very fresh that melts in your mouth.  My kids love the BBQ that comes on sizzling hot skillets.  I tasted it and it's the real Korean BBQ<//Review>

There are a lot of shops so you can find pretty much anything you need there. I think good dining options is the only thing this mall is lacking. But there's a Wetzel's Pretzels, so im happy with that! It's under construction right now but when it's done I think it's going to look very nice.< /Text>

Great mall for the Oceanside area. I used to live in the area for years until I moved to Riverside County. I still come up in the area. This place is not ghetto. Better than L.A.</review>

This place can feel a bit dodgy. It has more parking than actual retail space. A major remodel is underway though; totally worth checking out.< /Text>

A newly updated mall with a brand new movie theater, tons of restaurants inc a brand new Dave & Buster's, a new Luna Grill (high end dining, incredibly amazing food). Both the Luna & Panara have beautiful outdoor seating. Laser tag and my kiddos say a pretty good at arcade area. All the same shops as most indoor malls as this was a Westfield previously but The Shoppes have made amazing improvement, great mall staff & security so I'm comfortable with my older teens shopping with their tween sister outside my immediate view. They still have plans & parts are still going to go under updates to modernization of the indoor, outdoor as well as building  upward within the next few years. Also great toddler play area, trains within the mall, a beautifully maintained merry-go-round🎠< /text>

<Text>This mall has really been improved between tne new restaurants (yard house and cheesecake factory to name a few), from the revamped interior its definitely a great place to shop. The major area for improvement would be parking. The parking is absoulutly terrible maybe with all of the added foot traffic someone can get the idea to invest into a parking structure.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>The mall revamp looks great. The kids play area however is dangerous. Big kids running around running over all the smaller kids. Every time I’ve come someone has been hurt. It’s sad that they allow what looks like preteens to run wild there. Ive been several times and it’s always the same. I wish security would at least stop by to ask the bigger kids to slow down.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dc71890ff40c13:0x61f48bacf713a5ee< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Kids playground inside. City bus station right next to it. Sears, Maceys, JC Penny, 24hour fitness, Brand new Regal Theatre, Lots of good hot food places to eat inside. Lots of places to shop for up to date fashion. Best everyday fresh food Luxe Buffet in North County San Diego which is well worth the price right next to the Carlsbad Westfield Mall. I recommend this place.</Text>

Would give it 5 stars but ongoing construction is a big nuisance right now.  Hope they're done before Christmas. Besides that The Shoppes Carlsbad is great for a stroll with the fam and shopping.<//Text>

Right now there's a lot of construction going on in and around the complex, so it's hard to judge right now. It is looking better every time I go there, though, and it seems like it could be a pretty trendy place once all the stores open.<//Review>

The carlsbad mall is becoming amazing they have tons of new stores and resutrants that make the mall look just nothing like it was before and if you go there now they won't be fully done but when you see it you will be like i can't believe this is what it turned out to be like.< /Review>

<Name>Bren G< /Name><Date>1527174190831< /Date><review>I have mixed feelings about the mall. They have re-done it recently. Not a lot of shops, main ones are Macy's, Sears and JcPenny. Small stores H&M and ones I don't know. More fancy more expensive shops. Lots of restaurant choices - Yard House, Luna Grill, Cheesecake Factory, Dave and Buster's. Play area in front of JcPenny for kids is nice. They have USB ports to charge phones and nice chairs to sit on for the parents.< /review><GmapID>0x80dc71890ff40c13:0x61f48bacf713a5ee<//GmapID></record>

<Resp>None</Resp><Time>1539628073676<//Time><text>I'm very disappointed in the security at this mall the other night I was sitting in my car getting ready to go inside the gym when one of the security guards Buzz my car and almost hit it with his security cart. This morning after getting out of the gym cuz I have a membership here 24hr fitness. I stopped to eat my lunch in front of the Sears by the train station a lady security guard came up to me in a vehicle and park right behind me so I got out of my car and took a picture of her in her vehicle. she pulled up and asked me why I took her picture I told her you guys have been harassing me and the other day one of your colleagues almost hit my car with golf cart going real fast I asked her what their problem was? She replied there's no loitering in this lot I laughed I told her I just came out of the gym and wanted to eat my lunch and informed her I would be talking to the mall management about the behavior of the security staff. 12 years I bodyguard and I was a security guard and a security consultant for Flower Hill Mall and beachwalk Mall in Solana Beach. I thought to myself I'd never seen such unprofessionalism from security guards in my whole life. As an ex bodyguard I observe everything I see people who are working on the mall drinking beer and hard liquor and they're worried about me eating my lunch or stopping to read in my car before I go in the gym and workout! Hey Mall you better address your security problem or somebody might take litigation against you. If you need somebody to educate you on the powers of arrest and security officers rights and what they can do and what they cannot do give me a call I would be more than glad to educate you being that I have 12 years experience of doing this. To all the people who visit this mall Beware Of The Reckless security Behavior take notes and take pictures and documentation. Here Endeth the lesson!< /text><UserId.>116242271363995511504< /UserId.>< pics>

Once upon a time this mall was not just a shopping area, but a destination. Today nearly half of the "shoppes" sit dark and empty, and those that are open have almost no foot traffic. One promising store I visited was half empty because of a massive water leak and had a musty smell. The skylit courtyard has mismatched sofas and lounge chairs for patrons to rest.

One highlight is the Comics-N-Stuff. For so many eclectic items it is clean and bright. There were plenty of people there offering to help and the selection is massive.<//text>

While waiting for the remodeling to be completed, I do enjoy the Regal Theater the most. I tend to run late more often that I's like to admit, therefore pre-purchasing my reserved recliner is amazing. I am looking forward to the new shops. Since I grew up in the Tri-City area this was my mall of choice.< /Text>

<text>This place is horrible the employees working at the beauty bars harassed me (a minor) when i was trying to buy ice cream and called me fat. Management did nothing. Worst experience of my life. I was so embarrassed and the two ladies were so rude. Don't go to this mall, it looks terrible and has the worst employees who fat-shame people for buying ice cream.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Wow.  I am so disappointed in the appearance of the first large remodeled building at this mall (Regal Theater).   Coming along the freeway, or the surface streets, anyone can notice the random gray tiles on the façade do not blend, nor match the décor and color scheme on the remainder of the building.  I thought architects and designers of such buildings are supposed to present a "pleasing" appearance to the public, to make them feel welcome and desirous of shopping there.  It has the opposite effect on me.  But what do I know, I just have to look at it.

The atmosphere is great especially in the patio. Kaylee our waitress has a great personality, is very attentive and her uniform is clean, too.
I've tried before the San Marcos area and today were our first time at Islands in the newly renovated Calsbad mall. The food tasted good, I ordered the "Moa Mauna Loa Crisp with grilled chicken breast and Caesar salad" it's healthy this way then fried, and was definitely delicious. Husband ordered the "Maui Burger" which goes great with French fries, and looks good too. Served with passion fruit Iced Tea they even brought to me honey to mix with the drink. Since I don't add artificial sweeteners, thought was very nice they have something like that you just have to ask.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

They have a Cheesecake Factory, and a Dave and Buster's (which uses tricky "credit" conversions to get you to pay over $1 just to play Skee Ball). Also, FYE STILL smells like mold, so if you're sensitive or allergic, I would suggest avoiding it. The only reason I still go there is because my kids like Hot Topic. But, it's really mostly upscale clothing shops now. It seems really pretentious now, not like a place for me.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Love the remodel and the new kids play area, it could however add a second one along with family restrooms. It gets 3 stars because most of the shops are empty not many to chose from. It lost a lot of great family friendly shops before the remodel. I hope some of them come back soon. The anchor stores also need to be remolded as they look like an eyesore and out of place compared to the rest of the mall.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Empty but I think its because they're barely opening some of the stores... maybe? Tried to get something to eat but there's no food court, yet. There's only Dave and buster's and like 2 other things.</Review>

<text>The mall cops called the Oceanside police to eject the steampunkers who wanted to ride the merry-go-round.  The mall management offered the steampunkers free tickets, but required that they notify the mall before they visit.  Yet none of the wannabe gangbanger-attired young people have to notify the mall before they visit.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

New outdoor remodel above 24 looks like tiles fell off (the discolored grey ones that look like a gas bathroom or some that covered up vandalism with the wrong color of paint).  The whole mall needs a remodel and attracts unsavory shoppers that have no pride in where the hang out.

I don't know why anyone would shop here.  24 hour fitness is ok though.

They have been remodeling forever! All their major anchor stores are still old, outdated and don't even carry half of the inventory that you can fond at the Escondido mall just 20/30 minutes south east.</review>

The security personnel are very unprofessional and RUDE. The mall itself looks like it's about to fall apart. They don't have alot of stores either. Go to North County Fair. It's a little further out, but it's worth it.< /text>

This mall is so sad. The interior is dated and always looks dirty. The movie theater is now the only reason we will go there.</text>

It appears this mall is being shut down, lots of close outs and the indoor walkways seem not very well maintained. Old building I guess.< /review>

Very disappointing selection. Also the layout is INCREDIBLY awkward, there's no food court for instance. All of the food is just scattered around. Some stores also are vacant of people.<//Text>

I went there and suite #100 is the main office.

The people in information said there is no such store.

There is no listing on thier directory.

I called the number and it rang 20 times. No answer.< /Review>
