<review>I feel incredibly lucky to have found a kind, compassionate and experienced dentist office here in Lincoln.  I was in pain, and was seen quickly after my 1st call.  Truly a caring group of ladies!
And Dr. Hermo is fabulous!  Gets right to work and checks in continuously to make sure you are comfortable.  I highly recommend Dr. Hermo and her staff!</review><userid>108748819648826852211<//userid>< name>

I highly recommend "Tooth Spa Dentistry".  I've been a customer for about 4 years and have received excellent care.I had veneers put on and have received exceptional service.  They are quick to fit me in for appointments and I've never had to wait.  The dentist and staff are very friendly, caring, gentle and a pleasure to interact with.  I look forward to my visits.  They even have a massage chair which is an absolute bonus.  I am so pleased with the service I receive.< /text>

<Review>We’ve been here at Tooth Spa  Dentistry  since 2017 until now, We love everything about it from the ambiance to the staff and Doctors, everyone is so accomodating and professional. The Doctor is really good she knows  her stuff by heart. Staff are diligent, reminding you every now and then about  sched and stuff , for someone like  me who always forgot stuff i really appreciate it. Glad we found this clinic when we moved in Lincoln,  we can smile widely without hesitations. 😊< /Review><user_name>Mary Right Aquino</user_name>< Pics>

< review>
Haphazard Dentistry. Highly Unprofessional.

- I recieved 7 fillings total: 4 of them have either fallen out or had to be replaced, just three months later.
- I saw the 'hygienist' reuse old gloves, and he kept burping in my face.
- My 'cleaning' was conducted wit a water pik, no metal instruments.

Conclusions: Poor communication, appalling hygiene, and my teeth have been in pain ever since. The lists of complaints goes on, but I don't want to appear to be dramatic--simply stating the facts of a terribly impactful and unbelievably poor treatment.< /review>

<review>Absolutely wonderful team! I've had a fear of dentists ever since I had a bad experience when I was a child. I hadn't been to a dentist in years and was pretty embarrassed about my condition. Everyone at Tooth Spa made me feel totally comfortable. They were polite, kind, professional, extremely knowledgeable, to the point and fun all at the same time. They were very sensitive to my comfort during the session. Also they use the most modern and up to date technology, which definitely helps you feel more relaxed and confident in the chair. Not to mention they play great music in there! I won't be missing checkups anymore 🙂<//review>< UserId.>

Made appointment,  hadn't been to dentist for a few years , I have sensitive teeth.  Informed them I EXTREMELY sensitive,  they said no worries.  They  reschedule twice , due to covid-19.  ( I'm ok with that)
Then LITERALLY just a couple of hours before my appointment,  they  called me and said they wouldn't work on me because of how sensitive I am. Again they cancelled my appointment. They said from beginning, they would have no problem working on me, they would give a topical if needed.. when they cancelled,  (day of, 2 hours before appointment)NOW they won't use topical..
This place is a complete joke..
So disappointed with them..
Very very dissatisfied..< /text>

<Review>I used to be afraid of the dentist from bad past experiences in my childhood. My tooth filling had come out and I was having heat and cold sensitivity. I knew I had to get this taken care of. I went in and to my surprise, I had the best dental experience of my life! Dr Irene and staff are so nice and friendly. And her techniques are amazing. I’m telling all my friends about the Tooth Spa. A relaxing experience for my teeth 🦷

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>The experience at tooth spot dentistry is one of the better dentist offices that I have experienced. Wait times are very little, and the expertise, professionalism, and friendliness is a great thing in my book.   I have to drive one hour to go see Irene and the whole experience with the driving time in mind makes me feel more at ease with the above stated.  Dr. Irene has skilled hands that did my deep cleaning without numbing shots (obviously with the numbing gel though!).   I highly recommend going to tooth spa dentistry if your current dentist makes things seem a bit difficult at times and your curiosity might change your dentist!< /text>< gmap_id>

<Review>Unfortunatley, my experience was terrible! Receptionist is incompetent with appointment information, was very rude and unprofessional. I have been a registered dental assistant for 20 years ( retired out) and know how a great office should be handled. I didn't even stay for my appointment as I had such a bad vibe from her and her poor attitude. New patients beware about going to this office with this front office woman. I have never, ever had such a bad experience going to a new business.< /Review>< resp>

I had to check with my babysitter and said I would let them know within one hour of leaving the office.  My sitter wasn't available at that time so I called and let them know right away (within one hour of leaving their office). They told me "I cant cancel or reschedule my appt. " Or I will be charged $50.  They said they require 48 hour notice. However ,I had just left the office one hour ago when they scheduled the next day appt. Which didnt make sense i would be charged $50. I then made a follow appt.  when I could. When i got to the office the receptionist said she "cancelled my appt. " I had the appt scheduled for 6 weeks. It Was real inconvienant.  They then sent me a letter saying I cant come back because they claim "I missed two appointments?" They cancelled my appt   I was there.   Im Rather surprised at this treatment.  I'm a single mother and only rescheduled one appt within a hour of making it.   I made all other appts.  Dont go here unless you like your appt cancelled and no one notify you. Dont go here if in the event you have a emergency come up and have to reschedule.  They will steal $50 from you and make it difficult to return or not want your business anymore.  I doubt they will stay in business long with the way they treat people<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I was given a cap on my front tooth, and two weeks after they put it on it chipped (randomly, I was just sitting in my couch watching tv) and now it looks like I have a broken front tooth. I called them and they said it wasn’t their fault and I would have to pay out of pocket to get it fixed. They didn’t help me at all, they just left me with my “chipped” tooth.</text></record></dataset><record>

I was skeptical trying a dentist that takes DHMO. Usually their all about bringing up their patient numbers and not about building a  great practice. I needed an emergency root canal. I contacted Premier Access Dental. While I was on the phone with Customer Service I was yelping for a good dentist in my area. Tooth Spa Dentistry cake up with great reviews. I called the office on Friday afternoon and spoke with the Office Manger (she is maxing) and she was able to get me in on Monday. I went into the office and they were very professional. The office is beautiful and calming. Very impressive. Dr. Hermo was super educational and patient with me. I was put on antibiotics and asked to come back on Thursday for the root canal. I was fortunate to get a call on Tuesday and asked to come in on Wednesday morning at 8:30. Dr. Hermo came in on her day off and took 3 1/2 hours out of her day to do an amazing job on my mouth. She continually checked on me and asked how I was doing. When my dental insurance switches to Delta Dental PPO I will be able to stay with her. She takes many different dental plans because she believes every patient should be given top notch care regardless of your dental plan. The root canal was done back in March of this year. As of today, I had my first cleaning with the office. The dentist did my cleaning personally. She knows I’m scared to death when a denstist works in my mouth. She kept asking me if I was ok. I feel this is the best dentist I have used to date!!! She has the best office staff as well!!!< /text>

We recently had our 14 year old Honda Odyssey in for some oil and fluid leaks. We were sent a link with a detailed description on  finding of issues, which included photos. We were called within 1 hour by Amir, to discuss each line item and prices. When compared to Honda dealership and Shannon’s auto repair, they definitely had the best prices. And as I mentioned before have the continued quality and warranty  that we’ve used over the years.
Again communication, pricing, quality and warranty is why I use and highly recommend Folsom Car care!

We have been taking our vehicle here for maintenance for several years. They are friendly, professional, and trustworthy.

Folsom Car Care Center provides quick, reliable, and thorough service. Amir, the owner, was very polite, friendly, and helpful. I had severe tire damage, but when I called another location, they told me they wouldn't be able to see me for at least a week.  I called FCCC, and Amir was able to fit me in the same day!   When I entered the business, my first reaction was that it was very neat and clean.  The waiting room was very spacious.  I was quite frazzled, but Amir assured me that he would take care of anything, and not to worry. He assessed the damage quickly, called me, and ordered the necessary parts to fix my car. The next day, he told me he would try to get the repairs done that day, but wasn't sure if he could. Well, he did! I even checked with the mechanic to ensure that the brakes were working properly, and he was also very professional and friendly.

I highly recommend Folsom Car Care Center if you are in need of a repair.  Amir will reassure you and provide great service!  Thank you, Amir!< /Review>

We have a Subaru Outback with a new battery. Last night we needed to use the car, but the battery was dead. I scheduled an appointment with Folsom Car Care. I called to let them know I was going to make arrangements to get my car to their shop. Instead, they came to my house (I live about 3 miles away). They jump started my car, took it back to the shop and checked for issues. Thankfully, nothing is wrong with my car. They got the battery to work and said that a cabin light may have been left on (I have a five year old so...). They drove my car back to my house and did not charge me. I am grateful I live in Folsom and discovered this auto repair shop. I am impressed and will continue to use Folsom Car Care.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Took my car in for a drain and fill on my Lexus is300 and an oil leak inspection. These guys went above and beyond and ended up replacing my valve covers as well as the plugs and a coil that got oil all over them. Not only did this fix a problem I've been having with my car for some time, but my car now runs better than it has for years. I will definitely be coming back to this shop again should any other problems arise.< /review>

I decided to take my Chevy Avalanche to Folsom Car Care Center because my mom has been going there for years for her car maintenance. After being towed in this morning, I was contacted and told my fuel pump needed replacement. The owner explained the diagnostic results to me. By 1:30 I was told it was ready to be picked up. It runs great once again. I appreciated the owners taking the time to talk to me and make my feel comfortable. I was really impressed by the precautions they took to keep me and others safe! Thanks for the great experience!</text>

I got two of my cars fixed, at Folsom Car Care. It was a chance finding, next to my doctors office. They were very professional, clean, and truthful about the rates. Their diagnostic was perfect. They found the right problem, and fixed the same on both of my cars. Both of my cars are running great. All of the engine warnings are gone, any sounds from the engine in also gone. Next time I have any problems with my cars, I now where to go. I will also refer all of my friends to trust there their car repair to Folsom Car Care.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Just had a great experience at Folsom Car Care. I dropped off my truck for an oil change and when I picked it up I noticed the driver side door handle was loose. I told The owner Amir about it and he said he would look into it tomorrow since it was already 5 pm. I brought it back the next morning, Amir found out a screw had fallen out holding the handle in place. He replaced it at no charge since I told him it definitely was not loose when I dropped it off. It was just a weird coincidence that it dropped off at that time. I have been going to FCC for 22 years with all my vehicles for just that reason. Great customer service !

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Dropped my car off for an oil change and to look into my not working A/C, and was quoted $158.
Received a text stating a belt needed to be replaced and that the A/C was leaking due to the condenser needing replacement, new total $949.
When I called I explained I couldn't afford a new condenser they stated they'd still do the recharge, but couldn't say how long the A/C would work given the leak. Figured it was worth a try, told them not to replace the condenser, but proceed with the original recharge and oil change and to replace the worn belt. Confirmed with the person on the phone what the new total would be and what would be done. New Total: $346.
When I get there to pick up the car, a different person is at the front desk than who I had been working with previously, I ask if the A/C was still blowing cold, he tells me they didn't do a recharge because I did not replace the condenser. I explain my call and the employee says they can't do that because it's illegal!
Angry because I was lied to but understanding that they couldn't legally do the job and I confirm what was done which was just replace the belt and check the A/C. I look closer at the work order which stated they would only CHECK  fluids not change.

Their only response was "we didn't charge you for the freon" and that I could wait while they changed my oil for full price. I declined. Walked out spending $326 for no oil change, no A/C, and a new belt that I'm no longer sure even needed to be replaced.

Bottom line, I couldn't trust their word. If it's illegal to recharge without fixing a leak? Fine. But that was known by them when they said it would be done, how was I supposed to know? Why confirm they'll do an oil change and never write it up? Do not wait until you have someones payment in hand to tell them all the work you did not perform.

RESPONSE TO OWNER REPLY:
Very sad that this business continues to lie. I WAS NOT CONTACTED BY THIS BUSINESS AT ANYTIME, I was NOT offered any free oil change, I was NOT called the day after yet alone once a day for 3 days.  Your response here is the ONLY communication I have had from your business since the scam service I received.

Your response only confirms your willingness to lie  and comfortability in doing so.

< Review>
History: Initially I was looking for SMOG after moving to the area and stumbled on  Folsom Care Care Center last year.  Just a basic smog inspection made me realize that there are still honest and hardworking repair faculties out there except for dealer. Amir (the owner)  made me feel at home and attended to my car in very professional manner while I sat down and sip hot coffee in a Starbucks like environment (the waiting area). The coffee, TV with news and the cleanliness was so great that I decided to use them as all my car needs going forward.

Recent experience: Yesterday I called Amir again since my dashboard was giving me suggested maintenance light for brake and cabin air filter.  I was attended with great dignity, respect and was accommodated same day for the service. Not only I saved money by not going to the dealer, I left with a very good feeling after the service since the car drove better after newly flushed brake fluid and smell great since I never replaced the cabin air filter and after the fires the car smelled like fire zone inside.

I am very particular about my cars. Even though they are old, I try to take care of them and am glad to find dealer alternative right here in Folsom.

Try them and you will not regret. I can't promise they will fix all your car issues, but I can certainly say that you will get an honest, straightforward answer to your car problems.

I am glad that I found Folsom Car Care Center and above all I made new friends. The owners, Amir & Samina, are great people and you can't go wrong with exceptional service to go on top of it.</Review>

Both on the phone, and in person, the Service Advisor  David was very professional and courteous. Furthermore, he did not pressure me at all to bring my business to his store. I was impressed by this. At the store, David to a keen interest in all my questions and concerns; he was so attentive and gave me such detailed responses that I thought he is the franchise owner or General Manager of this location. Jaime is the other person with whom I interacted when I arrived at the location. He was also very polite and professional. The facility is clean and well-maintained. I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends and neighbors.</Review>

This place is TERRIBLE. They hired inexperienced technicians that couldn’t fix my car correctly and timely from the initial service. I had to keep bringing my vehicle back for them to correct the problem from their mistakes and their poor workmanship. I would not recommend anyone to bring their vehicle to this place.  This place is so slow and has no business, technicians are sitting around talking and eating, and the parking lot is empty.< /Text>

Tried this place three times for smog test. Bad experience each time. Disorganized and slow. There are better places. Wont be back. First time, lots of attitude from the guy behind the counter. Second time, the guy seemed disinterested and not interested getting things started. Third time, very slow, even though every bay was open.

Update: Yes, I know the difference in names, and yes, it was Folsom Car Care Center. Since you can't find a record of the three smog test, I did there, that would explain your disorganization. Won't be back. You had a SMOG special, which is why I went. Three strikes you're out.

Saw that you claimed on someone else's review, you had no record of them. Guess its a pattern, to blame the customer. Sure some give fake reviews, and I deplore that. Mine is real.< /text>

When shopping around for a new starter for my 2004 Honda Pilot, these guys were by FAR the best pricing in Folsom.  I called 5 different auto repair shops and they not only had the best pricing, but also same day turnaround.  Very impressive!  They even text you a link to a comprehensive vehicle health report once your vehicle is there to let you know the status of various different components and include photos showing if potential issues exist.  They are really ahead of the curve when it comes to service and the technology they use to keep customers educated and informed.  They have a customer for life!  Oh, and they do $30 smog specials too.  That's cheaper than anywhere I've ever heard of!<//text>

I've been in a couple of times and had excellent service. They are personable and kind. Good value for your money. Fairly quick. I waited in waiting area. I had some water and a biscotti. The owner came and sat with me for a few minutes. Got to know a bit more about how they became the owners. All and all a great experience each time. Recieved some coupons and a Christmas card a few days later. Can you say awesome. Nice decorations and clean bathroom. I recommend you try them. They have excellent mechanics that care too.<//review>

Finding a good vehicle repair place is always a struggle.  After years of going to a place in Orangevale because they were a family friend we just weren't happy anymore for lots of reasons.

A really good friend of mine recommended Folsom Car Care (FCC).  This friend is a DIY guy when it comes to fixing cars.  So someone who really knows cars and repairs giving us a recommendation to FCC was a real endorsement to me.

My first experience with FCC came last year after my sons car lost its  AC.  He was a week away from leaving for college out of state.  We took it to a "specialty"  AC repair shop and got a quote for just over $2,000.  We took it FCC and they repaired it quickly because of our time frame for less than a quarter of the "specialty" quote.  It has been more than 12 months and the AC still works great.  The fix was a simple pressure valve in the system that was slowly leaking down and a few other parts and a AC service that needed attention due to the age of the 2005 car.

Just recently my other sons truck needed a few Chevy service bulletins completed and general maintenance.  The truck is key to his job that pays him well for a high school kid.  We took it in on Monday for all of the repairs and got it back less than a day later with everything perfect.  He was able to start work again Wednesday morning.

I don't know everybody that works there but Jaime and Eli have both worked on my vehicles and they have come back with great work.  I am sure the rest of the team there is equally up to the task.

In the last year we have been there for:
-Navigator AC repair
-Suburban 90K maintenance
-Passat oil change
-Suburban oil change (we put a lot of miles on this vehicle)
-Chevy service bulletins and general maintenance

FCC is a quality shop with integrity and fair prices.  I highly recommend them for all your auto servicing and repair needs.

Part Two...
August 17 2020

My son was using his truck for work.  He called and told me the check engine light was flashing while he was on the freeway and when he got off the engine was running rough at idle and low speeds..  The truck has run great since it was in there in early July.  I told him to limp it home and we will deal with it in Monday.  I did some research and figured with the symptoms It is was probably a misfiring cylinder.  I have done plug and coil replacements before and I hate them. Invariably there is at least one plug that is in a bad spot to get it out and back in.  The 2004 Silverado falls into that category. I took it in told them what I thought and waited for the call saying we needed new coils and plugs.  A little more than an hour later I got  a text saying the truck was ready for pick up.  I asked what the issue was and was told it was just a loose wire to the cylinder.  During COVID when businesses are struggling to make ends meet and reman open Folsom Car Care is a great example of doing the right thing.  They could have easily called and said it needs new plugs and coils for $400-600 I would imagine.  But they took care of it for me without doing an unnecessary repair.  Thanks again guys...<//Text>

Friendly service but I brought a car in for a pre purchase inspection and at the end they told me it looks good but when I got back to the dealership ready to make a purchase I noticed the report said that the mechanic wasn’t able to connect to the computer to read the codes! And I specifically asked about that at the beginning since except for the codes I could inspect the car by myself... called them and the guy said he forgot to mention it. But didn’t forget to charge me full price for half an inspection. At the dealership they were able to show me the codes. Just a general bad feeling.< /Review>

They then ended up knocking off a piece of piping to my water pump they tried to offer a zip tie to keep it on but no other help and it was the day before i had to go to Tahoe for work.
I went to folsom car care and told the owner what happened they looked up my part and it was 4pm they had the part come and my car was fixed in less than 30 minutes i was still able to get my kids from day care on time too.

I was so Thankful not to be ripped off and to get fast service addressing just the item i needed fixed no high pressure salesmen just gently reccomend eventually replacing my water pump in the future.

Great owners and mechanics love this clean family owned business always support local owners.

Thank you so much Folsom car Care Family 🤗🤗

<Text>Folsom car care replaced a wheel bearing on my Toyota Sequoia which was causing vibration in my car while driving.  After their job, the vibration was gone even at 75 miles per hour and my car handled fine off-road as well.
I am happy with their work and the only surprise was the need to also replace the emergency brake part.  Eli gave me a break on price due to an underestimation of work time.  I appreciated that he stuck with his word.  I’ll be going back.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I had them do a complete brake job on my car.  After only about 3,000 miles the front brake rotors started to warp again and the brakes vibrated when I slowed down.  When I took it back to have them check for the problem, without hesitation they replaced the rotors under warranty at no charge.  I was totally satisfied with their response and work.  My SUV has been perfect since that work was done.</review>

<review>I tried this car repair shop and I must say that I have never gotten such great/professional service and expert advise from any car repair place that I have used in the past.  The staff was courteous, friendly and most importantly, very knowledgeable about various aspects of car maintenance.  I had my SUV's shocks and struts changed, alignment done and misc other items repaired.  I made an appointment a day earlier with a rush request and the staff respected my timeline.  I was there to pick up my car by 2:00 pm on the day I dropped my car.  Thanks Folsom  Car Care Center!< /review>< Name>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>had recently fixed an mis-aligned bumper and a cracket screw socket due to a small accident, David is awesome and very innovative, got a nice job done in less than an hour, and only asked for 50 bucks with this solid fix, including parts and labor, while a typical body shop will almost for sure cost hundres of dollars and all the hassle of appraisal appointment stuff.
I highly recommend this shop, they always surprise me, in a good way,  on how low cost and high efficiency a car fix job can be done.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1577483538240, 'text': 'Thank you for your support:-)'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x809ae6996bd75577:0xf35f034f5ac4a8e8</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Finding an honest auto repair business in your local community is such a great thing. These folks have been working on our cars for over 8 years now. I recommend them to every one I know, and I can do so without hesitation. In fact we even have them do our our regularly scheduled service, saving us from having to deal with the car dealer. They are the best!< /Review>

<Date>1527074965815</Date><rate>1</rate><Text>They ruined my car key.  After service was completed I tried to get in my car but it would not open the door.  I went back in to make sure they had not given me someone else's key.  They then tell me my key must have been messed up (showing me the teeth on my key is gone).  One of the folks working there must have done it intentionally because this kind of a thing does not happen by itself!  I have always used my remote to get inside my car so how could the key have gotten worn out by me?  Stay away!!!

RESPONSE TO OWNER'S POST:  My review is accurate.  You can't find my name in your records because the work order was under my wife's name.  So to re-emphasize, my experience was quite real and disappointing.  I have proof (photo) I can post online if you'd like.< /Text>< pics>

Let me tell you first that I am not an avid review writer, In fact this is the first time I am writing review for anybody out of my work place. I must say, guys at Folsom Car Care Center are just awesome! They take really great care of your car. Accurate estimate and fast response. On top of that, on the day of my drive test at DMV, I realized that my car's rear indicator bulb was fused. I called them and they immediately fixed it and guess what it was for FREE! I always had great experience with them and would strongly recommend them to everyone.< /Review>

I paid for an estimate at the local Dodge dealer, and all I got was a price and "you need to replace the engine."  Folsom car care explained to me in detail what was wrong with my truck, and gave me several options (including their recommendation to replace the engine) to address the issues, which built trust in them.  They helped me arrange financing for the repair. Best shop I've been to in the last 40 years.< /Text>

My daughter lives in Folsom and we were visiting her family when we got a strong coolant smell in our 2000 Ford Expedition, but only when we accelerated fairly strongly (which we only do when traffic requires it).  My son-in-law had taken his car to this outfit for some routine maintenance and seemed satisfied so I thought I would give them a try.

First of all they spent almost a full day before even looking at the problem then after another full day they said they had pressure tested the cooling system and found the leak in the upper radiator hose and recommended strongly that I also replace the lower hose and the thermostat (because all were original to the car).  I agreed and they changed me $430 for this work.  Of course, once I returned home, I had occasion to accelerate again and, guess what, the issue was not fixed at all.  I took it to another shop at here and after a prompt pressure test they told (and showed me) that the issue was a leaking heater core which ended up dripping coolant into the passenger compartment (hence the strong smell inside).

On the basis of my experience, I cannot recommend this shop and would encourage you to look elsewhere for your car care needs (perhaps excepting routing maintenance items).</review>

< Review>
Ownership has recently changed and so has the service ! The manager told me Elton and Claire Carlomagno sold the shop a month ago.I brought my Dodge Diesel pickup in for a smog test and it failed for monitors not being set so after the 3rd attempt my monitors were set but the  mechanic working on it set a check engine light by plugging in his computer to check things so it failed again. At this point I wanted to talk to the owner ! The manager told me the new owner Amir has less than 6 months knowledge in the automotive industry so I was better off talking to him ! I also found out the shop is no longer Smog Star Certified which means they cant even smog half the cars out there. I also wanted to change my oil on my wife's car with good oil like Castrol but they dont sell good oil ! They use cheap oil and filters like you can buy at Walmart or Jiffy lube ! Good luck people paying higher prices at this shop thinking your getting quality parts and service ! I just wanted to let the community know what some of the changes that are going on over there ! I just found out a week ago that the 10 year veteran Manager is leaving this shop aswell ! So looks like the new owners will be rebuilding their staff ! Wow now i'm looking for a new shop to service all my cars ! Just wanted to let the great Folsom community know about the updates on this place ! Good luck and best of wishes if your a customer at Folsom Car Care !</Review>

I went in for an ac diagnostic and they did that, and on top of that they fixed every leak in the ac system that my beater of an accord had and recharged it for no extra cost< /Review>

They do good work. Didn't take too long. I just don't go if the line is out the driveway.  I try to go when they aren't super busy.< /review>

I tried this place because the place near me raised their prices without improving service. M&J is much better than the place on Slauson I was using because they use power washers in addition to the regular brush wash. The vacuum job was great but they was was excellent and they had plenty of staff in the am when I went to get my car done quickly</Review>

It's my go to neighborhood car wash. It's right by my house. They do a good job. The downside is the wait. I can't recall a day that I have not seen this place crowded. Even early in the morning, cars are lined up on the street.< /Text>

My experience with this Car wash was terrible. After waiting forever for a car wash. I noticed that a set of my rubber thermo mats where missing. The owner wanted to run the camera back . Mind You I am disabled & he insisted that I come to the little store area which was a good walk for me with a cane. He didn't care. I walk there slowly & he didn't even know how to work his camera. I was there waiting for about 20 minutes & he never showed me where the mats weren't taken or missed placed. I was with my sister. I was just recently discharged from the hospital with pelvic bone issues. I am going to purse my money for my mats & report him to the better business bureau. It doesn't matter how low you've been in business; my mats were missing & I immediately brought it to their attention. IMMEDIATELY I THINK HE WAS VERY PETTY; WHILE I AM A FREQUENT CUSTOMER THERE. I WILL BE BACK THERE TOMORROW. EXPECTING TO BE PAID FOR MY MATS....SMDH.....< /review>

This car was ripped me off for my car mats that were in my car under my plastic mats. My Thermo ware mats. The owner couldn't even play the video back for me to prove they didn't take them. I am disabled and they were very inconsiderate to my condition.  I will NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. I HOPE THEY ENJOY MY MATS...CROOKS<//Review>

<UserId.>109888855771190461182</UserId.><rate>3< /rate><Response>None< /Response><Text>well, yeah .. the car got cleaned in a decently good manner, no question about that. they also dried between the door jams and put on tire dressing. however, the method wasn't very paint concerning .. meaning they scrubbed a lot with always the same utilities, leaving those minor scratches behind that make the paint loose gloss over time. but for 15 bucks, this is what you get, apparently. newer car owners are better off going to an automated touchless car wash and do the drying part themselves, I'd suggest.< /Text>< Name>

My go to car wash!!! They do a great job and their prices are amazing. But be prepared for a wait. There's usually a long line and it's a hand car wash.< /Text>

Hit or miss on cleaning but mainly hit. There are a lot of stunnas that get their cars cleaned here. Dont be surprised if a Lambo rolls up. Usually there are people selling cds and movies near the entrance. They only accept cash and accept tips.
If it's busy, expect a wait of at least an hour.< /Review>

When we left I thought everything was fine. But then I got a copy of the medical report and there was two other issues but they never mentioned to me. Noted it on the report but didn't discuss it with me, if I hadn't have got a copy of the report I would have never known. Aside from this our visits have been very good</text>

<Review>The hospital on Bonita is exceptional.  They did a stand alone rabies for my dogs annual licensing  No fuss. No muss.  The location has a lovely lawn, garden area, where there is comfortable bench seat that's perfect as a waiting area. The vet has been there, forever, so I think that says a lot too!</Review>< Pics>

< review>
I am a LaVerne native, and would never take my animals anywhere else but here! The staff is loving kind, and willing to go the extra mile to make sure your fur baby is treated with the utmost care and love. We now live in Arizona and were visiting my parents in LaVerne, we had our new rescue, an adorable Chihuahua, Josie, who had been previously locked in a cage for 8 years before We rescued her and she had extensive surgery before leaving Arizona. I called the LaVerne Animal Hospital to have her stitches removed from her spay and declaw removal. The staff got her in right away and treated her with such love and care. I was worried sick because I was afraid my little baby Josie would be so frightened. But she came out with her tail wagging and a smile on her face and absolutely no pain. The young lady who helped us treated Josie as if she were her only dog. And to top it off, they did not charge us a dime to remove the stitches. I was floored! A month later we visited Cali again and I took Josie there to have her claws clipped. Again, they treated her with such care and love I was scared to death she would be frightened beyond belief, however once again, she came out smiling and happy with her tail wagging! The veterinarian assistant who took her from me held her closely and with love in her eyes. The price for cutting her toenails was more than fair. I absolutely adore this veterinarian hospital and will never go anywhere else anytime we visit California and take our precious Josie with us. We love you, Laverne Animal Hospital... Your love and care for animals is over the top. Highly recommend! See you again in a month! ❤️</review>

The more you love your pets the more they will gouge you if they have a pet that's really sick they will take you through every step until they get to the point our point was nine hundred and some dollars before they took a $56 test and diagnosed cancer a little cat.... I should have went with my wife the first time so they couldn't do that I wouldn't have allowed it!< /Text>

<Text>I brought my beautiful, sweet dachshund in today to be put down. It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. Saying goodbye to a pet is never easy, but Dr. Burnett and his staff helped me to get through it with such care and compassion! Thank you so very much for your kindness.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Took my beautiful dog there to be put to sleep. They were so sensitive and kind. I think I even saw tears matching my own in the vet's eyes. I felt understood and supported. So grateful.< /Review>

Highly recommend La Verne Animal Hospital, they have always been very caring and non-pressure in the treatment plans for our dogs.
They saved one of our dog's life this past week.
They went the extra mile to make sure we can't the care our dog needed.
They had recommended another emergency vet clinic because they thought they would be able to do the required testing faster.  The other place didn't think the testing was necessary and recommended a very expensive treatment plan.
After hearing that the tests weren't preformed La Verne Animal Hospital ordered the tests and called us Saturday morning with the results and recommended treatment plan.
Can't think them enough.
Highly recommend them for all your veterinary needs.< /text>

<text>Dr Burnett is passionate about his work and we have always felt like he and the entire staff, really values our patronage. Appointments can be made sometimes the same day, most of the time within 24 hours. Easy parking either behind the building, or on Bonita right in front. Medications are fairly priced; competitive with online pharmacies for meds requiring long term use. Lab tests are done for good reasons, and not to take more of your money. We have referred several neighbors and friends, and they have all stayed with LaVerne Animal Hospital. Dr. Hwang is also amazing; fully certified DVM, who also has many clients with pets successfully treated with acupuncture.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1550523623877, 'text': 'Thank you Vicki, We do our best to offer medical options and stay competitive with our pricing and maintain the quality of care we’ve set for ourselves.

I have been bringing  my pets to la verne animal hospital  for over 10 yrs. Dr Burnett and Dr Wong are very experienced and caring!!! All their techs are great  as well. Some may consider their  practice on the expensive side but I feel they try to save you money whenever they can. They never try to oversell u on services that are unnecessary like other vets I have been to in the past.<//text>

<review>Dr. Huang and Dr. Burnett are both great. We would never take our dogs anywhere else (except when they refer us to a specialist). They and their staff care a great deal for the animals they treat.
From my wife, my dogs and myself, thank you, all of you, for all of the great care you've provided for our dogs over the years.

Edit: It's been four years since I wrote my original review above. Since then, Dr. Huang has left and there are now two Dr. Burnetts (I don't know if they're related). As awesome as Dr. Huang was, my wife and I are very happy with the new doctor. She figured out our big boy had spleen cancer and (along with the rest of the staff) was a great help in dealing with his end of life care nine months later. However, the main thing that prompted this update is how she handled our little girl's recent issues. Our little one had an allergic reaction to something a week after getting TPLO surgery. The hospital notified our regular vet, and the next thing we know, Dr. Burnett calls to check in on her. She didn't have to do that, but she knew our dog was going through a rough patch and was genuinely concerned for her. Thank you Dr. Burnett and the entire La Verne Animal Hospital staff. You provide an invaluable service and continue to prove that our trust is well placed.<//review><UserId.>103348601942728699100<//UserId.><date>1588525343394< /date>< Gmap_id>

While our business closes at 5:30 we have clients picking up their pets after hours, or a last minute appointment we choose to accommodate and wait for their arrival, so we have posted do not park until after 6:00 PM.  Our private property has 3 parking spaces.  Since our clients often bringing in sick or injured pets  having to walk a couple of blocks presents a great difficulty, and more so for our elderly clients.  Thus we have had to become more vigilant in not allowing non clients to use our parking spaces.

<Rating>1< /Rating><Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I know that this place is favored by many locals but I stopped going there years ago due to their forgetfulness to perform the services requested and their rudeness on the phone as well as the front office. They're service is also on the expensive side of veterinarians. Today I parked in their designated parking at 5:34pm and verified the hours of business posted on their window to be 5:30pm. I return to my vehicle shortly after 6:00pm to a threatening notice that my vehicle will be towed if I park there before 6. I understand that parking is difficult in that area but their enforcement is over reaching. Please respect their decision to be rude to their clients and public and refrain from going to their practise and parking there.<//Text><name>Chris Eckeard< /name>< date>

<text>The Local Bug Guy is fantastic! We have used their service for several years now and it makes such a difference in managing creepy crawlers. Our Bug Guy is Matt and he is wonderful!! Always professional, friendly, just a really nice person who takes pride in his work and cares about his clients. I am scared to death of spiders and Matt always makes sure to pay special attention. If we have spiders pop up between our regular treatments he always works right in on his schedule and never makes me feel silly or like a pain for calling. I would absolutely recommend their service. And ask for Matt - he's the best!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Not only did they treat the house, but they removed all webs around the exterior and were very detailed on what to expect and the services we may or may not need moving forward. Their pricing is also very affordable which makes using their service that much better :)< /Review>< Pictures>

Needed some help on controlling ants around the house. Local Bug Guy has great reviews so I called them.
Set up an appointment for treatment date. That date came and we got a call stating that he would be at my location In 15 minutes. Notification gave us time to secure the dogs.
Once arrived he was very professional and very thorough in his scouting for the source of the ants.
Once ants where found the war began. The ants took slot of casualties but not wiped out in the first battle. By the next morning it looked like the Bug Guy won the war.  Now we are back at a Cold War monitoring our borders.
Thanks Bug Guy< /Review>

Our tech was Eric and he was just awesome! He gave us some pointers on how to help keep the ants out by trimming some of the vegetation around the house and found three points of entry that the ants were coming in to the house from cracks around the house and the foundation. Totally recommend for anyone looking to solve their ant or spider problem.</Text>

Not only have we never, in over four years, had a big problem, but Wayne is very friendly, helpful, and willing to go above and beyond to help us out! He’s been responsive when we needed to reschedule and took extra time to come inside to take a look at an area I was concerned with under our island. I’ve started making a point to be available if at all possible when Wayne is coming to spray because he’s always pleasant and it’s great to have a quick conversation with a genuinely nice guy! If you are looking for a company to protect your home from insect infestations, this is your company and ask for Wayne! You can thank me later!<//Text>< Pics>

The Local Bug Guy has been a member of our team for over 7 years. I say member because they feel like part of my home upkeep team. Each technician we have had is personable, makes a concerted effort to discuss our individual needs instead of just showing up and avoiding me like other pest control companies. They are friendly, professional, on time have competitive rates for service and most importantly they are available whenever we need them! Payments are easy to the company as well. If you need a pest control team member, you can do no better than Local Bug Guy.</text>

I have been extremely grateful for the effective services from The Local Bug Guy! Lee is so professional, reliable, and personable, and has been keeping our home and property bug free for almost 2 years now. He goes above and beyond for what little we pay each quarter, the value they provide for peace of mind and comfort is appreciated. No more worrying about the hot weather coming and looking all over my kitchen to see if any ants creep in and then having to inconveniently clean out my entire pantry, or throw away food, or having to cringe while squashing pesty spiders. I will never have that worry again because the consistent maintenance visits I receive from them is working. I highly recommend their services over any other company around.<//text>

It’s been a month since I switched my pest control services to Local Bug Guy and I couldn’t be happier! My Bug Guy, Jared, is awesome and has been extremely thorough and professional. Having grown up in the Temecula and Murrieta valleys, I’ve had plenty of experiences with different companies and THIS company is, hands down, the best I’ve ever had! I like that they are local, have great prices and provide one Bug Guy as yours, which really makes my wife, kids and dogs much more comfortable. After my first service, I had some ants show up around my dogs food bowls (nothing uncommon for our area regardless of who I had service with and my dog is a messy eater). The difference; I text Jared, he immediately responded back, and less than 30 minutes later he was here. He subsequently spent over an hour searching out the source of those annoying little bugs, spraying anywhere and everywhere he could find where ants were coming onto our property. Yesterday, just a little over a week later, I even received a follow up from him to ensure that we were still ant free and didn’t need additional treatments. Now that’s service! Thanks Local Bug Guy and Thanks to Jared for the fantastic customer service!</review>< gmap_id>

I get a regular treatment every three months and never see an ant inside the house, but recently they’ve been very active and have showed up in my bathroom and master bedroom. One call to Mike, my regular service technician, and he was out first thing the next morning to deliver an extra treatment free of charge. Thanks Mike!< /Review>

He was very patient with my random facts I was spewing at him, which I appreciate because being a sahm now my word vomit when interacting with adults is horrendous. We walked through the property, showed where most of the problem areas were. He explained everything he would do. He went above and beyond so that my daughters would have no worries about widows while playing outside. He even got back out of his truck because he wasn’t sure if he forgot a part of their toy area. 100% recommend them.<//Review><UserId.>104752683904117673396< /UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80db81c6b66569cf:0x21f364c6975aecf4</Gmap_id><Resp>{'time': 1592065292063, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience!

<Text>Love my service, Brent was super helpful when signing up and mike has been nothing but exceptional when it comes to service and punctuality, he strives to be the best and he definitely is. He is great with the dogs, always super friendly and when the bugs get bad before our next service, he is always willing and never makes me feel bad for the extra trip (my previous company would complain, make me feel bad and usually try and bump up our service!). We are so completely pleased with our service we will never go anywhere else!</Text><user_id>110197217040228644352<//user_id>< GmapID>

Best company ever. Local bug guys gives you a peace of mind that your house and yard are being protected in the best way possible. They make scheduling appointments easy and hassle free. Matt is always quick to answer our calls and solve every issue that we’ve thrown at him. He’s always super professional and has the best customer service ever. He tells us exactly what the problem is and how he’s going to solve it while putting our child and dogs safety first. I’m so happy that we picked the local bug guy out of all the other company’s out there, we’ve used them for a few years now and never plan on switching! If you are looking for exceptional customer service then look no further, Local Bug Guy is the company for you!< /Review>

Without a doubt, the BEST people to do business with. Brent and his team are excellent at explaining everything as they go to keep their customers informed. They go above and beyond our expectations every time by offering to spray extra areas as preventive or even coming out in between services for free touch-up sprays, if the problem persists. Mike is our bug guy and he's always super professional, friendly, and courteous. He takes the time to let us know when he'll be showing up and he does a very thorough job. These guys are all awesome and my family feels taken care of. Highly recommend their services to anyone and everyone!< /text>

Too bad there isn't a 6th start available!  Have had pest control service through the Local Bug Guy for several years now and have never had a single issue.  Yes, ants will come.  Yes, black widows appear from time to time.  It is nature in SoCal after all.  That said, the team has always promptly resolved any issue and kept the creepy crawlies from entering our home -- all for a VERY competitive price.  The staff is all super friendly and willing to go above and beyond.  Brent, Eric, Julie and the rest of the crew fantastic.  Highly highly recommend!< /Text>

Local Buy Guy is a great company, and our assigned Bug Guy, Wayne, has been awesome to us for the past three years. The quarterly service has worked amazingly, but sometimes ants will make a cameo appearance in our home during the really hot weeks of the year (though honestly, not that often). Each time that has happened, I've sent Wayne a panicked text and he has been very attentive and showed up to help us out right away.  A++<//review>

Can I just say how impressed I am with these guys? SUPER personable, professional and funny. Not to mention they were timely, informative and got the job done. Just finished my first service and Matt was thorough, yet quick! Assessed the property, gave us some tips and said he'd check back in 10 days to see how everything was going and should another service be needed, FREE of charge. Now that, is service! 5 STARS!< /Text>

I have used many pest control companies and Local Bug Guy is by far the best! The company is extremely professional, friendly, responsive, and experts in their field. Our house has been bug & spider free since starting, which was my biggest concern. I called in regards to a mysterious insect in my garden and Matt knew what it was without seeing it. We suddenly had an issue with a couple insects outside (including ants) and they are individually being treated. I called at 5:00pm yesterday and Matt showed up to my house first thing this morning!<//review>

Our Local Bug Guy Brent came and serviced our home today. As always he was on time, thorough and provided exceptional service. We had to step away and he called us to let us know what he was doing, what he had seen and the treatment plan he would be doing on our home. He made sure that we knew the possible problem areas as well as verifying that our ant issue has not returned since we first used the Local Bug Guy services. Now that means 3 years and still counting without any ant infestations in our home. Exceptional service and they treat you like family. We love our bug guy and look forward to many, many more years of service with them.<//Text>

<Review>These guys are awesome! We signed up with them after we discovered how much the ants were loving our fruit trees and then, when that wasn't enough, made their way inside. Of course, we also battled spiders, like many others in the area!
The first conversation with Brent went great and he was super informative. We were assigned Mike, as our bug guy.
The first time Mike came by, we didn't see any ants for days, but then they came back with a vengeance! The guys came back a total of three times, for the price of one, just to ensure our pesky guests weren't going to stick around. We feel really taken care of and haven't had a bug issue since we started up with them. Thank you Brent and Mike for caring about our family and loving what you do! It shows!< /Review>< Pictures>

Phenomenal service, the friendliest people in the world, punctual, and knowledgeable! My assigned bug guy is Matt and he couldn't be more wonderful. He always goes above and beyond, he's friendly, courteous, and knows what he's talking about. I found that other companies will strap a tank on a young person who knows nothing but to point and shoot the spray... but not local bug guy! They take the time to hear your problem, discuss it, and fix it. The key is: they can do this because they are all knowledgeable about bugs! I will never have another extermination company again!

Superior communication! Brent is great! You get notification when he will be there and if you need to change the day, he is extremely flexible. Service is so much better than Terminex! Price is better and service is 10x better! Quick response to any questions! Same day service if needed! He goes the extra mile to make sure you are happy with his services! He makes sure to be aggressive. He is very proactive when it comes to treating your house and yard. You won't be disappointed!<//review>

<review>This is a fantastic company.  I had a terrible ant problem initially - in the walls, etc.  They completely eradicated them in two trips. They come in quarterly for maintenance sprays and I have had NO problem with any bugs since.  When they come they always ask if there are any specific problems to address.  All this, and at a cost lower than their competitors.</review>< Response>

The Local Bug Guy team was prompt, courteous, sincere and very knowledgeable. I have a wall of ivy and fruit trees in my backyard that seem to bring all the spiders to our yard. My young son(2yrsold) is very active and loves to explore in the same areas that these spiders are building webs and nests. The service tech showed up within the expected time frame and showed more attention and interest to my concerns than any other provider has previously. He took the time to show me what to look for, what to expect after his visit and provided a fantastic customer service. I am very happy to have found this company!<//Review>

I highly recommend Brent (The local Bug Guy)! I have not seen ANY bugs in my house or any alive outside. I have found plenty of dead spiders outside! Which to me shows that he does what he says he will (Kill those bugs!). He makes sure that you are happy with the service and he thanks you for being a client. I am so happy that a friend recommended him to me. I had just moved into town and needed my place taken care of. The previous tenants/owner never had the place treated. Brent made sure our house was ready for us to move in. Don't waste your time with other places, Brent is the best in Temecula!</review>

Brent is the absolute best! We have had his service since we first bought our house back in early 2011 and couldn't be happier. His service and professionalism are outstanding. We haven't had a single problem. Even if you were to experience an influx of bugs, he is more than happy to come out and spray again, even if it's before your scheduled spray date. Top notch service :)< /text>

Brent just came by at the end of the month for our scheduled service. He is honest, reliable, and really knows his stuff. We've been using his company to control the bugs since we moved here two years ago. A lot of people recommended him and we are glad we listened. He walked through what he does, gave me ideas of what to look for between services, and really goes above and beyond to educate the customer. The office is great at communicating! We get email reminders about our next appointments, he checks up on us after a service to make sure we are satisfied, and in general has excellent customer service. I sure am glad we chose the Local Bug Guy as our bug guy. Brent and his team are awesome!</Text>

Local Bug Guy is way more than just exterminator services!  It is a company whose business model is steeped in relationships.  I cannot recommend Brent, Julie and Jimmy highly enough!  On my very first service appt., Jimmy went far above and beyond to insure I had all of my questions answered and insured he sprayed in places I hadn't even considered,.  His personal touches did not go unnoticed.  Beyond that, their prices are more than fair and their guarantee is reassuring.  SO glad I made the call!<//Text>

We moved to the area a year ago and heard that Murrieta/Wildomar area can have BAD ant seasons. We just moved to a new home and wanted to get ahead of the season. I choose this company because it's a local small business and they only service a small territory to better service their customers! I thought that was great! I had the pleasure of meeting Brent during our initial consultation/spraying, he was very personable.
He explained his process and how each of the products he uses works.

Our regular tech is Mike and I couldn’t ask for a nicer technician, very personable. He listens to your concerns and suggests the best solution based on your needs.
Also unlike other companies when you become a regular customer they start getting lazy. That is NOT the case with Local Bug Guy. Always thorough and each visit is done like it’s your first appointment! Meticulous.

They also use a digital invoice system that makes paperwork and payments a breeze!

The ants have stayed away since last season but I know that I won’t have to worry when the ant season returnens because I know they will be available when I need them and the get the job done right!</text>

<Text>I hired Brent at Local Bug Guy to treat our townhome for Argentine Ants right after we moved in.  Within a matter of minutes, he had located the nest under a few dead tree stumps in our neighbor's backyard. He treated and within a couple of days, the ants were gone.  I would gladly refer Local Buy Guy to my neighbors and friends in the Temecula/Red Hawk area.</Text><Time>1334471726876</Time>< Gmap_id>

<review>This company is the BEST! We needed to hire someone fast to get rid of our ant problem and had a preference for a local company. My first positive interaction was with Julie, who could not have been nicer and more accommodating to fit us in. She was so pleasant to talk to and took her time in explaining why ants come in the house and what they do to treat it. The next day, Jim came out to spray and take care of the ants. He was also extremely nice, patient and thorough in explaining to us what he was doing and what we needed to do afterward since we have little ones and a dog. Truly exceptional company with wonderful service. We are so glad that we hired them!< /review></record>

<time>1524773732696< /time><rating>5< /rating><review>My husband and I moved to Temecula a few years back, our first summer in our home we experienced a huge infestation of sugar ants, not just inside but outside too. The ants covered our outdoor water faucets and got into our electrical box. Inside the ants would trail all over, especially the bathrooms. It was horrible and my husband and I tried everything to get rid of them but nothing worked. We thought it might of just been a bad summer but the following year the same problem. I was sceptical about hiring a pest control company because I honestly didnt think any of them could help, I was wrong. I have been a customer of Local Bug Guy for almost a year and have never been disappointed. Matt is awesome! He is friendly and very thorough, he explained everything and always answers all of my questions.  Since the first time Matt came out to spray I haven't seen a single ant in my house! Thank you Matt and Local Bug Guy!</review>< Pics>

Let me say that Brent is awesome! He knows Temecula and knows his bugs! I am new to the area and apparently I live on the epicenter of all ant and black widow activity in Temecula. I tried for weeks to get them in control - but to no avail. I needed someone and fast - luckily I saved that colorful post card flyer that was left in my mailbox!

I called Brent, emailed him, and then I left a note for him on his website (yeah it was that bad...) Brent responded almost immediately and was out the next day. He quickly explained the issues, how to keep things under control, and the importance of not squashing the ants while they dined on the traps! (This is an important point! Resist if you can - let them feed like Nero and poison their friends!)

I am bug free and under control today - it's been two weeks and I'm in heaven! Thanks again Brent and I am a customer and a fan for life! Call Brent - make him so popular that he has to expand so our friends to the north can get the same great service as the lucky ones in Temecula!< /text>

<name>Dana Sugg</name><text>The best exterminator around! We finally found Brent after a bad experience with another Temecula pest control company and I was so impressed with him!  I had a major bug emergency and I called Brent in a panic.  He came over ASAP and was courteous and professional and solved the problem right away.  We switched to him for our seasonal maintenance and are so glad that we did.  He communicates ahead of time, as well as follows up to make sure everything is ok -NO ONE ELSE does that! He is professional, punctual, effective and I recommend him to everyone in Temecula!<//text>< Resp>

This is the best pest control company we have EVER dealt with. Their rates are fantastic and the service they provide is way way beyond their competitors. Since using them we have never had fleas ants and spiders are completely under control including outside. I can not recommend this company enough. Beat service I’ve ever had.</review>

<review>I had Christine as my realtor and she was the most unprofessional, rude and condescending. She couldn't even get me what I was looking for. She was always late and never returned my phone calls. I even met up with her at a home and the door was locked. My range was anywhere between 6 million to 10 million and all she wanted to show me was places that was 12 million and up. She couldn't remember anything I was looking for...does she have dementia?? Really disappointed as I really wanted to buy a home in the LA area. So instead I fired her and went with Chrishell. Thank you Chrishell for helping me find a home. This is the only reason why I gave it a five-star.</review>< Pictures>

one word......tacky! one of the agents RIPPED a lengua taco STRAIGHT from my husband and told me she had dreamed about a house with living clocks in the attic. i told her my toes were numb, and we left quickly. not to be trusted. should’ve went with goblintown realtors like my butcher recommended initially</Review>

<text>Rather than rate this firm based on realty tv, the review should be based on service levels to both buyers and sellers. I work in real estate in Scotland and looking at the Google reviews it’s totally misleading. Based on the average price of their listings then they must be doing business well. Good luck guys moving forward in Hollywood Real Estate. King-Residential, Scotland 🦁</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2bebce5ec475b:0x3c120e681c4aa39f<//GmapID></record>

<review>Love the show. I'm a little jealous that they're not in miami so I can join them. Jason seems to care about his girls enough so his business is successful. He's someone I'd love to work for. I can tell christine and mary are the only ones I'd get along with though.🤣😅< /review><UserId.>114422293827332638850< /UserId.><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

You don’t become known as the “dominant” real estate group in Hollywood Hills and on Sunset Blvd without putting in the backbreaking work. If you feel the appearance of these women is offensive then I would welcome you to take a good, long hard look at yourself (on the inside.) You can’t genuinely love yourself and criticize others’ looks. The Oppenheim brothers know that beautiful people sell real estate in their area and there is nothing wrong with capitalizing on WILLING and beautiful women.

I gave this business a five star review because of their reputation and success in this part of L.A.’s saturated market.

Lastly, the girls are hot, smart and successful, so either learn from them—or reevaluate your frustrations.</review>

I have thoroughly enjoyed the show. The people and places I can only dream about, but for the time it is on, I'm transported to my dream world and quite entertained. Hope to see many more episodes. (By the way, I'm a Senior citizen living in Ensenada,Baja, Mexico).</review>

<Text>I enjoyed the show but quite a toxic environment.
Of all the ladies, Mary is the most professional. She acts her age. Is calm and very talented. Her heart and head are in the right place.

Chriselle should find her own niche. She is clearly not wanted. She should stop bringing up her background, it was a little too much. Some memories and experiences are to be shared in certain places, at certain times. She doesnt have a friend there, even Maya is not. She was the one who spilled the beans.
Chriselle also talks too much. Not a secret keeper.

Christine: really admired you in the beginning but you are very trashy. Dont respect anyone even your boss. You are trying to show you are tough. Tone in down

Heather: 2nd most professional person. Concentrate at the moment. Dont mingle business with pleasure.

Davina: cant really place you. Direct, matured but you started this. You should have called out Chriselle from the beginning, in private. But you gossiped to Maya, who then told others.

Overall, the office is crawling with estrogens, so expect DRAMA.

Jason and Brett should get males in.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>Based on the TV show any place that allows bullying, harassment, and clear unprofessionalism is not somewhere I would spend my money. The Oppenheimer brothers should be ashamed to have a catty, distasteful work environment. The show is a true reflection of how this company would handle potential investments.

I called for a pizza like 30 mins before closing and they still took my order and wur very nice about it, unlike other places that are snobby and don't want to take any orders because its close to quitting time. The girl whom answered the phone was very polite and took down my order very well.  Plus pizza was(Is)very good.</text>

<text>This deserves a 5 star because the customer service was dynamite today.  I ordered a pizza for delivery and when it arrived I noticed how hot the pizza was still.  I live across town and the pizza should have been lukewarm but no it was HOT.  They forgot to add olives to one side and charged me for them.  I called them and the manager took great care of me and left no room for any argument.  I hung the phone up a happy customer.  Mistakes happen and it's how they are handled, today they were handled the best way possible.  Kudos to the manager today.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><UserId.>105234322598088578850</UserId.><date>1564453473868</date><pics>None</pics>< GmapID>

There must be some sort of magical formula that involves a tremendous amount of physics that goes into making a pizza. Every. Single. Time. I order a pizza from this place, they cannot seem to make it correctly. I pay for toppings that I don’t get or they put the toppings on the wrong side of the pizza. It’s absolutely ridiculous.</text>

The food is amazing and I would highly recommend the ranch sauce instead of the tomato sauce. The service is a little slow but the staff is really nice and always willing to help. They have something for everyone in the family, they have a press on tattoo dispencer, a game room and free television. Over all 10/10!<//Text>

Please be careful in reviewing hours — Round Table follows their own “winter hours” and rudely turns customers away early well before the posted google hours, based on an 8 1/2” x 11” printout scotched taped on their door. Do not rely on this franchise to be open as posed.< /review>

There's no problem with the food. The pizza tastes fine. I do have a problem with the prices. It is the most expensive corporate pizza franchise in Sonoma. I put that cuz i have no clue if restaurants in Sonoma have pizza on their menu or what the cost is. But this place is 45 bucks for a large pizza and a few garlic sticks. It is more expensive than Mary's Pizza. Round Table is 300 percent marked up. Its a rip off.<//Text>

We ordered a medium pizza they said 45 minutes. Ok. 1.5 hr later it shows up as if it has been sitting on the delivery dudes seat for 2 hours. Cold cold gross. In fact the wings were the same way. Donot buy pizza from this one.< /review>

Food was fine, but it was slow and they forgot to bring us our drinks. Not very impressed by the service, but pizza was delicious</Review>

Ordered the pizza for delivery at 6:39 PM. The promised time was 7:38 PM. Called at 8:20PM as pizza didn't arrive and am told it's out for delivery. Delivered at 8:50 PM. Pizza is ice cold; it's not kept warm during delivery.  The kicker is that the delivery distance is less than a mile. Avoiding the chain now.</Text>

<text>Place was messy and disorganized. It looked like a childcare was set up in the closed dining area. Went for light desserts. No one else was there but the two employees who didn't say anything to us. We spent about five minutes looking at the menu while the employees cleaned. One walked past us and no one acknowledged we were there trying to figure out what to get. We left and still no one said anything. (FYI; they didn't close for another 1.5 hours)</text><pictures>None<//pictures><gmapID>0x808e417c621ae905:0xdba5c60619a2b5dd<//gmapID><Response>None</Response>< Name>

I ordered hot tea, they delivered me an empty glass without water! In my opinion, it is obvious that if a person orders a drink, he wants to get a drink, and not a tea bag in an empty glass. I am very upset;(< /text>

Lets start of by saying how wonderful their staff is! Upon entering we were greeted automatically with great service. They have a lot of drink options and desert options. The boba itself is very tasty. They even offer a variety of spicy noodles, which heads you are  but the flavor itself is delicious.

The layout of the restaurant is super cute, defiantly family  friendly!</text>

This out of the way Boba Bar has great selection, friendly atmosphere, and pretty good flavours. I hope that they are able to succeed despite being nearly invisible from the street, as it is one of the better Boba locations in the community, and serves snacks to boot!
(More places should have an arcade machine like this~)<//Text>

Their service is quick and friendly. Their tea flavors are a little limited but super delicious- I love their rose gold milk tea and the classic tiger milk tea. The boba is also perfect, and the rose gold has real rose petals on top. Cute! I wish they'd add more things, like maybe a sea salt cream or toffee? But even without those options I'm satisfied.< /Review>

Awesome taiyaki and good stop for boba and kids slushies after a hot day at the beach. If you order before you drive over, the drink is ready for pickup immediately when you arrive. No wait!< /text>

Yay a good boba place in Scotts Valley! Definitely will be a regular! I love milk tea but sometime they can get too sweet. I love that at this place you can adjust your sweetness level to match your preference. I tried the sea salt cream for the first time and the flavor surprised me at first, but it really grows on you as you get the perfect mixture of salty and sweet. Their snacks are also delicious! I can't wait to try all the flavors, and I will for sure be back to try the rest</Text>

<text>It’s such a sweet atmosphere! All of their bobas and teas I’ve tried are amazing and I highly recommend the ice cream waffles and taiyaki too!
Very chill place, good for hanging out with friends or doing homework.

This is a place that specializes in boba! I go here or get it Door Dashed whenever I can. They have a pretty large selection and readily offer milk substitutes. They carry milk teas, smoothies, lattes, teas, taiyaki (depending if the machine is warmed up or not, an order of this may take up to 10 minutes to make), slushies, waffles, and a selection of Marrianne's ice cream. They also have a few Korean style snacks. My favorites include taro milk tea with boba (boba is 50 cents extra), Earl Grey milk tea and rose garden milk tea. They also offer several toppings like flavored popping boba, mochi, clear boba, and a couple others. Customer service has always been excellent and quick.<//Text>

If you substitute a different type of boba they charge you additional charge. It's just a different type from what was included. There drink sizes are relatively small. They don't let you choose s sweetness level< /review>

Drinks are fresh and sweet - but not too sweet. The secret is in the tea, I think. It's brewed just right and doesn't taste like the bagged stuff you can get from the supermarket.
As for the tapioca boba, it's just the right level of chewy and savory. And the egg waffles are crispy on the outside, while still fluffy on the inside.
I love stopping by whenever I have a craving for something sweet or refreshing.
My favorites: oolong black tea with boba when I want something cooling but not too sweet OR passion fruit green tea when I want something sweet and tart (they don't use syrup, they use passion fruit preserves so it tastes actual like passion fruit).</Text>< Pics>

Didn't even get to try it because they don't have what is on their menu. Very disappointed. If you don't serve it at this location don't have it on the menu.<//Review>

We've been regulars here for quite a bit now. We had an experience where we were confused with something on the menu and the owner (who I'm sure deals with this problem all the time) dealt with it in a less than ideal way. The owner dealt with it in an amazing way however. He talked with me about it and cleared the whole thing up. It takes a lot to do that and we are very satisfied with the quality of the customer service and the exceptional quality soul sweets puts out. If you're in scotts Valley and you want a delicious drink and maybe something sweet, come here!</Text>

<Review>Innovative offerings, very tasty, a bit too expensive. A fun hang out place. However they were playing music videos today that were inappropriate for young kids. I was there with my 10 year old boy and I was hoping he did not notice the screen. Chocolate filled waffle fish were delicious.< /Review>< date>

Delicious Japanese teas and treats! Went today with my family and had the Berry Lovers ice cream waffle. It was soo good! The waffle was really good, it had crispy edges, lightly sweet and was soft in all the right places. Highly recommend this place! This has definetly become one of my favorite places to eat!</review>

<Review>So I thought I would try a new hobby and learn to play guitar. Went here today and was shown 4 or 5 beginner models in my price range. Layla was very helpful in me making my decision. Walked out with a nice guitar in my price range with accessories also. Thanks for the help guys.

5 Star Service.  Great selection of Instruments! The staff team had great tips and was overall really friendly! I went twice, each day with different staff, but nonetheless, they were all equally as amazing! You're able to rent and the instruments they have are of fantastic quality. This is my go to music store now!< /text>

This is a really cool little neighborhood guitar shop. Not a lot in the way of custom or boutique level gear, but most everything you'd need as a working player or hobbyist.

I'm not sure about how their prices stack up, but we live in a world of MAP policies and internet prices. That just means everyone has the same price (for the most part). The cable I bought was a fair price, and GC didn't have the inexpensive version in stock like they did.

The people are nice and the store has a great vibe. I'll definitely be back.< /Text>

<review>Lol if you work here then sure you remember me as Tyler Johnson. I love this store and especially the events The Harvard Music Exchange has on Saturdays. The guitars this place has in stock sell for an amazing price, and a pretty good price for restringing and tuning on the guitars. I would definitely recommend checking The Harvard Street Music Exchange out sometime. They have really great service and the staff are very helpful and knowledgeable about the instruments they have in store, they are very willing to tell you everything you need to know so don't be afraid to ask them any questions. I am very excited on playing my first guitar and hope that one day I will play on one of the open mic events.

Great customer service, cool new venue.  We got a student violin here for a great price.  If they don't have what you need they are happy to order it and it comes pretty quickly.  They are also making an effort to advocate music in our area, by organizing and supporting live music events in downtown Hemet.  Definitely recommend this store!!!< /review>

<Text>It is a good store owned by good people. Staff is friendly. New location is nice with four booths being developed as quite rooms. The store is still in development, but is a good place for good equipment and no BS. I am sure it will be at 5 stars in no time. Prices are very reasonable.< /Text><user_id>111216539809935580065</user_id><gmap_id>0x80db6f4f84180bb7:0xa8db1affe5dcb908<//gmap_id><date>1459417138626<//date>< rating>

Found a used MXR distortion + for 45 bucks and Julio and the crew hooked up a guitar to test it out. He has great selection of guitars and the store has a great feel. Julio hooked it up with veterans discount and let me know about open mic on Saturday's 5 to 7.</Text>

Such a courteous, knowlegible. Helpfull staff.  They will spend time with you.  My visit was about a heavy duty microphone stand not even to be used for a stage performance.  I needed it to hold a hair dryer to dry pets.  He graciously helped me create the tool that I needed.  Thank you Jorge.🐾👍< /Text>

<Text>Left my acoustic electric guitar to be diagnosed on Saturday for no sound output. Was promised by Jason that it would be looked at and I would receive a call Monday with a quote on the repair. Monday passed with no call. I called Tuesday to check on it and the guy that answered seemed bothered and impatient with me. He said he didn't see my guitar anywhere in the store and had no idea what was being done with it. He put me on hold for a couple minutes and looked for it, it was still in the store. He abruptly answered saying, "I found it I call you back in a little bit" and then just hung up on me. 3 hours passed and I called back. Someone else answered and said the previous employee had taken it apart and then just left for the day. No call back again to let me know what was being done. Wednesday passed, no call back. I called today Thursday and was told they sent it to their outside technician to fix it, not quote it. I told them to just bring it back to the store so I could pick it up, I was tired of the run around and lack of communication on their part. Completely unprofessional and lack of customer service here. I will never step in this store again!<//Text></record>

The staff treat everyone like family, and they're very helpful with recommendations. The food is great, the prices are low, and the full-size portions well have you asking for a to-go box. They're buffet is currently closed, but I've had good experiences with that as well.

The wallpaper in the back is falling apart a little bit, but the restaurant itself is spotless.</Text>

Yesterday was the first time in this good restaurant. But It is surely not the last. We enjoyed the evening very much with the generous service, with the great  meal and booze and with the modest pay. We will definitely come back again.</Text>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>If you're hungry, for $15 you can eat your fill at this Asian buffet. Not fine dining, but filling. It's good, but not great. You come here for value. There are a few items that were really good, like the little sesame balls filled with red bean for dessert.

But over all, this is about filling up on the cheap. It was clean, quiet, the staff was friendly, and it's a pleasant experience for very little money. I basically gave it an extra star for value.</review>< pics>

Nice quiet clean buffet with good service. Not a large selection of entrees, however the quality of the seafood and sushi made dining very enjoyable. The fresh oyster with black bean was especially good. Unlike some other buffets, popular dishes were regularly refilled.<//text>

Ok place if you want a quick spot to eat. Friendly staff. Food wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. Not that many selection of food. The Mongolian beef section is very limited. So don't go there expecting a lot.<//Review>

Customer service matters... Until today I was a regular customer. at least twice a month but I will not return. I mistakenly left my credit card in my car and told the lady I needed to retrieve it. She made a BIG scene saying loudly "do not leave I ask my Boss"... Ask your Boss what I am not asking you I am telling you, it is not like you have a choice if you want to get paid..When I returned she continued about her job and showed me the receipts for the day trying t say "these people ram away too" Never will return.</Text>

Self serve Buffet lunch with Mongolian BBQ salad bar, sushi, dessert. Large dining room. Clean restrooms. They have a griddle to cook to order. Some confusion as to whether that is included. Servers were friendly.</review>

You can have an excellent, healthy and varied meal here. The key is to come early.

Definitely worth it.

I AM NOW REVIEWING AGAIN DURING TGE PANDEMIC 07/19/2020

Tell them what you woukd like and they will make it for you fresh and hot and healthy and excell3nt in every way -- tastu, and moet importantly very very healthy. I was unable to finish it. There was enough for 3 hungry people. Plus yoy will be supporting one of the beat places in Alameda.</Text>< Pics>

First time here, probably wouldn't go back. Overall mediocre food for lunch buffet, with terrible tasting sushi. I gave 3 stars since it is all you can eat and you can choose your ingredients for the Mongolian grill part.</Text>

As a child I would come here to eat with my family. I have to say I love it. Even though the food are basically the same, I love the customer service. The waitresses come out and talk to us. I've found out that the owner works here as well, not just observing from the sidelines. It's great for families looking for a place to eat.< /text>

<Text>This place pleasantly surprised us. You need to know what put on your plate, but once you figure it out the food is quite good for a buffet of this style. Specifically, egg rolls were hot, not oily and very tasty. Their macaroons are the bomb.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

They knew imdeietly what I wanted. The meal cost lest then $5 and it was amazing. They even went and made another batch of fried rice just for me. I sat down and began to eat and soon there was a steaming plate of fried rice in my face. I’ve never gotten this much food for $5 ever. The fried rice had chunks of ham and juicy carrots in them while the sesame chicken had a nice crunchy outside with and extremely juicy inside. My water was always being refilled which was great and I even noticed that they took the time to organized the sugar packets on the tables. They people there were extremely nice to me and I expect to be eating there from here on out. Disregard any of the 1 star comment because they are completely not true. This place will serve you and the employees put their heart and soul into their job. It feels like they never go outside because they are so focused inside. Please go here often, this place is out of this world.< /Review>< Pictures>

The food here is alright. Definitely not the best chinese food in the area. A lot of the food tasted as if it had been reheated and there was not a lot of variety at the buffet.< /text>

But the food was pretty good. For the incredibly low price, it could be much worse. They have a nice selection of food in addition to the Mongolian BBQ and sushi. The Mongolian BBQ could use a bit more flavor, but all around not bad.

Also the service was GREAT. The ladies who run it were very nice and attentive. I don't think my cup of water went below halfway the whole time I was there.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Awesome name. Like come on, how can you not go to a place called GENGHIS KHAN KITCHEN??? It lives up to its name too with an all you can eat buffet of sushi and cuisine. My only hark is some of the food tastes a little overcooked.</Text>

<Review>The place had great service but a horrible selection of food.They didn't have any spicy mayo for the sushi, no toppings for the ice cream and only one flavor, and no fortune cookies at the end. For an open buffet that's $12 bucks I would expect a wider selection. Also, refills are a dollar each on the soda.

But they do have crab legs for dinner that my dad loved, but I on the other hand thought were too oily.</Review>< rating>

<Review>Came in for dinner about 6:00, assuming the food would  be fresh and hot at that time.  It was neither. I've read lots of reviews of this restaurant and it seems that it has more sentimental value than food quality. Many people comment that they had been coming for years and the place is as good as it gets. It's not! Perhaps these people should investigate the Chinese buffet at ninth and Broadway in Oakland, only a mile away. Or one on International Blvd or on Willow Pass in Concord. They are four times as large, much greater selection, includes free soft drinks and a 10% senior discount. The price is only two dollars more than they Genghis Khan, a much better value.

To be more specific, I found that their sushi to be excellent and the proper was Sasabi and pickled ginger was available.  Nothing on the rest of the buffet compared favorably. The wonton soup was mildly flavorful but the wonton skins were mushy as they had  seem to have been cooked over and over. At 6 o'clock, the beginning of the dinner hour, most of the food on the buffet was only room temperature. It advertises a" seafood buffet", yet the only fish was a single flat overcooked and very unappealing filet of fish with the skin on. The mussels and clams were flavorless. The oysters while large and in the shell were not raw, as is common on other Chinese buffets, but had a dense and strange texture. When I inquired I was told that indeed they were not fresh but had been steamed. They were not served with any sauce. Steamed oysters? They were dreadful. I was disappointed. And the shrimp served in the fried shell was shriveled and tasteless. There were no tempting vegetables at all, simply a pan of chopped bell pepper and celery with a few tiny cooked shrimp thrown in, again totally tasteless. The only 'appetizer' was egg rolls, cold and greasy.

As for condiments, I've never been to a Chinese restaurant or buffet where the condiments were not available on the individual tables. These were not and one had to dish them up in small plates and carry each to the table individually. What shocked me was a large bottle of Heinz ketchup on the condiment tray by the end of the buffet table. Ketchup in a Chinese restaurant??? I should have been forewarned when I came in and saw all the tables laid out only with knife and fork, no chopstick options. I guess people in Alameda prefer this rather bland and unpleasant preparation of food as there was not an Asian in the restaurant. They were all over in Oakland's Chinatown where the food is infinitely better.

On the plus side, I will say that the atmosphere was clean, cheery, pleasant, and the waitress was very attentive in clearing dishes and bringing fresh ice water.</Review>< username>

My husband has been wanting to try this place forever.. so I finally gave in and went. We showed up around 7:30 (They close at 9) and headed straight for the buffet - sat down and it was ICE COLD. Told our server that we were going to leave bc man, it was ice cubes. She even agreed that it was cold and understood that we were leaving. Lol! What a joke. Not a good way to run a business.<//text>

<username>David McCall< /username><Text>Can't beat it for the price.  I come in here for lunch. While the buffet food is not exquisite quality, when fresh it's as good as any asain buffet. What separates this place is the Mongolian bbq area. Since it's made to order it's always hot off the grill when it arrives to your table.  You get to decide what goes in and how to season it. It makes me laugh reading other reviews that state it (the Mongolian portion of service) lacks flavor.... guess those folks are not articulate in the culinary field...add more flavor (curry, ginger, garlic, satay, oyster, teriyaki, sweet n sour, soy sauce, Sriracha) if it lacks flavor! You are in control.</Text>< gmapID>

<time>1475612337833<//time><Review>I wish i could rate lower ive been to multiple Mongolian bbq all over the world and i can promise this is by far the worst! It is a complete joke i took one bite and told them their food was disgusting and horrible quality they said pay and get out! Three meats and like 5 veggies to choose from and its frozen crinkle cut veggies. Giant garbage noodles and 6 sauce choices which are all watered down and slosh mixed together. Please for everyones sake stay the f*@# away from thia place! I hated the bbq so i tried a piece of general tso chicken hoping it would salvage the trip haha i spit that out it definitely was not chicken!</Review><response>None< /response>< pics>

Terrible? Yes. Mongolian? Maaaaybe...

This is some kind of weird chinese seafood restaurant. Might be an interesting fusion but its not going to satisfy your craving if you are in the mood for Mongolian BBQ. Quality didnt seem good anyway.</text>

The owner charged me $12.75 for lunch... She said becoz i ate seafood... Oysters to be specific... But it's lunchtime i said... She started to argue... I just kept quiet but thats the last of me there...</Text>< UserId.>

This place is delicious I love Peruvian food. What I love about this place is that they have take out,recently they've added dine- in, and they have a patio for those who like to dine-out. When I went inside they have a station for sanitation, including but not limited to sanitizer, disinfectant spray, and they were wearing gloves and masks! I love the fact that so Inca is following the CDC guidelines because honestly these are the restaurants and businesses that are going to go ahead and survive especially during this pandemic. I ordered the Peruvian jalea, which is a mixture of seafood if you like the deep fried tempura pablo, breaded style seafood. What I love most about it is that it's a well served plate . Today my wife and I shared this plate and it was delicious because the price, the generous portion of the food,and the flavor is to die for. Now, just so you know they're not giving you the bread that they normally would if you dine in, but again with the seafood alone and the plate itself it's more than enough to hit the spot!<//Review>

<Review>Came here for a birthday celebration. We had a group of 17 people. Our server was a bit slow but it still got delivered without attitude. Food portion was big. Most of the food were cooked fried. Majority of the dishes we ordered was good and flavorful. Restaurant seating was not cramped tight. Enough space for us to move around. Overall, it's a great experience.<//Review><Response>None</Response>< date>

<Text>refused to service us and give me my order that i placed online. really shady and unfortunate. the workers were incredibly rude and unprofessional. also, they were not really following COVID-19 safety regulations. maybe it's a good thing they wouldn't give me my food? don't want to get sick.< /Text>< rating>

Arroz Chaufa con Pollo, Tallarin Saltado de Camaron are all great. The Lomo Saltado is the go to dish. You will fall in love.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>Always pleased with the service and food! Love this place! They recently added a beautiful new bar, sadly they only sale beer and the subpar alcohol. No name brand liquor, so surprised for such a beautiful bar addition.</text>< pictures>

We had high hopes for this restaurant, however we got food that appeared to be reheated in a microwave. The yucca, plátanos, chicken that we ordered was dry and tasted old. I tried to convince my husband it was reheated in a microwave because the styrofoam containers were malformed and the container for huancaina sauce had a melted lid. Come on. We spent almost 40 bucks on our food.  Won’t be back.< /Text>

So far these place doesn't disappoint.  Support this local gem.  Been a patron of this location since it was Mario's.
Although seating is outside, food quality still A+++</review>

Good that they are still open during the pandemic. They need better ideas to improve the tables they have outside. the property has enough space to have a nice terrace for outside seating. No bread this time.< /Review>

Enjoyed the whole experience.  The food was packed with flavor.  Our server ( Eyleen) was very helpful and since it was our first visit that was a big thing.  We will definitely be back to try more dishes.< /Review>

Sol Inka is some of the best Peruvian food that I‘ve had. The green hot sauce was on point and delicious.

The jalea de camarónes was crunchy and the breading made everything so buttery.

The Lomo Saltado and Mariscos Saltado were both very good and I enjoyed the smokiness that they had. All the ingredients were perfectly balanced. Having it with some green sauce made it ever better.

The chaufa de pollo was also very good, the sesame seed oil just brought together all the flavors.

My dish was he Jalea but I couldn’t stop eating everyone else’s dishes. :)

Will definitely come back before I leave LA and every time I come back.</Text>

This is a very nice family restaurant with authentic touches from Peru.It was our first time to try out this Peruvian restaurant even we passed by it after so many years. This restaurant was very popular with its own ethnic group. It was busy during the time we dined there. Is was full of customers and people were having fun. We ordered chupe de Cameron, chicharron de calamari and Bistec ala chorillana. The foods were so fresh and delicious. The chupe was interesting and different. It's tasted and looked like the curry in different forms. The broth was good and it cooked with milk, potato and shrimp no wondered it was good. Chicharron de calamari was fresh and yummy. Overalls, the dinner was satisfactory. The services were extremely friendly and courteous. This place has a very good vibe. All the foods here were authentic and well represented. There were so many delicious dishes on the menu we probably are back for more at this place later on.< /review>

I shared a shrimp chowder with a friend that looked too watery to be a chowder, but don't let the name deceive you as to the delicious soup that invited you to eat more.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and were sweet and tender.  In addition, the fried rice was unexpected.  I expected a Chinese flavored food, but instead was surprised by the aroma and flavor of the food.  I am looking forward to visiting again and trying some additional dishes.

First time having Peruvian food. Very delicious. I the saltado maricos.  Pretty much Peruvian stir-fried seafood. It had octopus squid and shrimp. I usually don't like octopus too much. And squid is just Okay. But their octopus and squid on point. It wasn't two chewy tasted fantastic too. Fries in the food were interesting and fun. Good amount of crunch to them. Then they have this green condiment. Where delicious. Highly recommend coming her. Big space and service is good.<//review>

food was fantastic but.. the we just couldn't catch a break on the service. they forgot something every single time they checked on our table and the checking in was very, very sparse and in between. My entree didn't arrive until my friends had finished half their food.. and they were all anxiously picking at their food to stall. restaurant was not busy. but again, the food was great so I'll probably try again.<//review>

<Review>Food is pretty good. Service is decent. However, if you plan to come as a party prepare for disappointment. The service gets hostile because they cannot and will not split checks between families. They can take a while for the food to be served. The server who is most aggressive is male. Beware.</Review></record>

I and my sister pulled up to Sol Inka at 8:53 pm. Sol Inka is advertised to be open on weekdays until 9 pm. As someone who has worked retail and catering, I understand closing kitchens early. What I don't appreciate is the woman who immediately turned off the "Open" sign as soon as she saw two black women pull up and did so with a wide smile on her face. It was the definition of rude and I will not be back there again. I don't recommend this space to anyone who wants to be served with respect.<//text>

<Review>we will never step foot in this restaurant. Very poor service. People that came after us served first, we ordered steak plates and plaintains. I
Finished eating my food and then the plantains are given to me half an hour later. The steak was tasteless.  Pricey and not good not worth it, Waiter never came to see if we needed more refreshments. Don’t waste your time.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The fixed three course Peruvian style lunch was authentic and delicious with an extremely reasonable price tag. Add a glass of wine and you are still under $40. The staff is very professional and addressed us by our last name. This is a no brainer with a stylish interior and mellow vibe. Afterwards you can take a stroll around the key to walk off your lunch.</review>< Name>

The only reason I marked it 4 stars is because they take a longtime to seat you. The food is delicious, the decor is charming, the service once you're seated is good. The place looked clean and parking was good. Oh, if your going to drink(hard liquor) they do not have variety.</Text>

Date of visit 10/19/2019 : I went to this restaurant because of the good reviews. I placed  an order for " Saltado De Mariscos". and Jugo de Maracuya.(Passion fruit) the moment I has a taste it was "sour" first I thought it was just  me. I had my mom and other family members taste it and we all agreed that was " sour" " not fresh" bad  smell and taste" we told the waitress ( friendly service ) she immediately took it away and agreed that something was wrong with the maracuya

I got my "Saltado de Marisco" the worse plate and flavor I have ever had in my life. Potatoes were soggie, no flavor at all and there was no juice not even a little, and the FEW  Mariscos had a weird smell needles to say you couldn't see it because it was all potatoes also the Salsa was nothing like a peruvian taste. I have had this plate in many restaurants and its always great. The plate was so dried I"m not lying., and looked like water was splashed on top and put in a microwave to soft it up. I called the manager which was not there, and the lady AGREED  that the plate did not looked anything like what I'd oder and the chef sprinkles water on top to make it soft!! seriously!!!  I couldn't even eat it.

The waitress that helped us removed the plate offered us to get a new plate but I didn't want to . I want to make it clear that the ladies that work there are friendly and great service.

To the owner and Manager: we go to your restaurant to spend $80 + dollars and we expect a tasteful lunch/dinner all I wanted was fresh tasty food and all i got was a plate that seriously looked like from 2 days ago. and no MARISCOS!! YOU COULDN'T SEE THE MARISCOS. ( see picture ) the french fries were soggy and water was poured so much that I could see it and taste it. I know that for a fact!
I was so disappointed after I Was told this is a good place to eat.

Maybe it was this day but the quality of food is VERY BAD AND ITS NOT COOKED FRESH!! I have attached pictures of my plate, there is No Filters, and also I have attached a picture of what my plate should look like .   I hope the OWNERS AND MANAGERS TAKE THIS REVIEW TO IMPROVE .<//text>

<review>Delicious food. Great service. We went on a Sunday, around 11:30 a.m. We were early and seated right away. Filled up fast - customers were soon waiting. The staff is attentive so everyone was waited on as we expected to be.<//review>< pics>

I'm a fan of this place. From before the name change (previously Mario's), our family has been coming to this restaurant and it's always been delicious. More recently, there has been a few mishaps with an order not going in properly and the speed of the service being slow, but I think it will get better and for the taste of the food we get from here, I'm okay putting up with a bit of a wait.</review>

The chicha morada had a funy taste, kind of bitter, then the rice on the lomo saltado was a bit cold and the soup on the 7 seas (7 mares) to us it was a bit lack of flavor. The service it was a bit slow and it wasn't busy yet. Restroom are clean and look nice.<//Review></record>

Great place. Always get a consistent, solid meal. The meats used are always tender and fresh, the portions are generous. I've yet to have a bad experience at this establishment, and would recommend it to others.<//review>

<Text>There are some good dishes here, but I feel like the meat is always a little overcooked and tough. For this reason I typically stick to a noodle or rice dish. We drop in every now and then and will continue to do so.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dd2b49d194e1dd:0xb73516256bec945c</GmapID>< Pictures>

I absolutely love the food here. The food is flavorful instead of places that drown everything in salt. The portion sizes are large and maybe even a bit underpriced. The facility is clean and the staff are friendly. Overall, it's always a pleasant experience coming here.<//text>

Pretty good. Great aji for that sauce to go with your dish. Tomatoes in dish were pretty meh quality wise, but the rest of my Lomo saltado was decent. Wouldn't say price matched the quality, but overall quality still up there.< /review>

This place is soooooo good! It changed a little after they changed ownership/name but still love coming here! But the bread they serve before the meal isnt that great (as it was before). We went there with young kids and they made a bigger mess than I anticipated. Not because they were deliberately making a mess but the bread they served would crumble and get everywhere. Okay for adults to eat but messy when kids eat it. But they were so nice and didnt make us feel bad for the mess. I really appreciated that. It was lunch hour too so they were getting busy.< /review>

Paid 26 dollars for papa a lahuacaena and lomo saltado. The sauce on the papa was extremely bland no taste whatsoever.  Tried the one olive that came with it and was also bland?  The lomo saltado was ok the fries thought were not fresh at all. The fries were soaked and brown from sauce.  I normally wouldn't go out of my way for a restaurant but the food was genuinely no good and expensive.< /review>

The food changed from 8 months ago. It's was good back then specially the rice and the bread. Now, it doesn't taste same. The rice is on the dry side and the bread is different. Less meat on the Lomo saltado. I won't go back for the price and quality of the food.<//Text>

Sol Inca is a Peruvian restaurant that has become a staple of the surrounding La Mirada community.  It has seen some name changes and change of personnel through the years.  Their place is clean and tidy.  Because it was originally a different restaurant sometimes the seating can be a little cramped.  I have been to a lot of Peruvian restaurants this by far for the quality of the food is extra ordinary.  I have not had a bad experience here.  My recommendation would be the chaufa de pollo or the lomo Saltado.  Seafood is always a specialty their but I have not experienced their wares in regards to seafood but I can only imagine with their quality in their other dishes that it will be outstanding.  You will have an enjoyable experience I just wish they would open the dance floor for a little Cumbria or salsa dancing.  Their bar is well stocked and is new.  Enjoy</Review>

Great food. Very tasty. Pesto pasta with chicken milanesa is my favorite with a dash of that green hot sauce they put at the table. Service is good also. Takes some time to get your food, but it's expected when it's cooked to order.<//Review>

Food is excellent, food is prepared individually so it can take a while.  Lunch rush could be problematic if your on a tight time frame.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.</Review>

< Review>
Food was tasty, the server was very nice and friendly, however the kitchen was extremely slow in putting food out we waited 45 minutes for the appetizer. Then another 20 minutes for the main plate to come out. When it finaly did it was cold, and incomplete, we had a party of 4. Three of our main meals came out and my mothers soup still took another 15min to arrive. When it finaly did arrive, we were almost finished with our meal, and the souo was boiling hot!!!! my mom had to bring her soup home, after all we had already been sitting there for over 1 1/2 hrs.. our bill was over $80.00 very, very, very disappointed. Will NOT come back.</Review>

<Text>I usually get lomo saltado or any beef item. Chicharron de pollo is also good but not a fan of the seafood fried rice. Place looks cleaner, more modern after renovation where they added a bar but looks like that wont be open till December. We got alcohol but the choices are limited. I'm sure it'll get better once they open the bar.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The prices have been raised $2-$4 per item and the quality and portions have diminished. They just added a bar and have a liquor license so I guess that is where all the money is going. You would be much happier going to El Rokoto Peruvian Restaurant in Cerritos - the food is much tastier, they have larger portions and the price point is similar.</Text>

This place used to be the go-to spot if I wanted Peruvian food back when it was called Mario's. Don't be fooled by the new name, this place will meet your expectations. Nothing really seems to have changed. The service was pretty good too.

I ordered the Lomo Saltado as usual, and it was delicious! No surprises here. And the waitress would stop by once in a while to make sure we were all good.

I would definitely recommend this place, not to just people expecting a taste like Mario's, but to anyone who wants to experience delicious food.<//Text>

Amazing place to come enjoy some Peruvian food . Since they usually have a wait, it's best to come on their non peak hours . Food and service was amazing. The food comes in large portions enough to share . Every time we come here it's always a great experience .</review>

Love the food. Price is a bit high for the lomo, and I was disappointed that there was harly no meat. Maybe 3 Oz strip.
Usally there is a lot of everything, but this time was very little meat for 17,18 bucks.<//review>

No one even came by to ask if we wanted anything to drink. We saw people that came in after us be seated and offered bread and drinks while we still waited. The place was not busy and they had more then enough staff. Their was only 6 7 other tables and most of them already had food. We ended up just getting up and lwaving.So not sure what all this was about. First and last time going here.< /text>< user_name>

My family and I went Sol Inka to celebrate my Abuela’s 78th birthday. We are Peruvian and very familiar with Peruvian restaurants throughout Los Angeles, Sol Inka did not disappoint!

Our table ordered a variety of dishes including Lompoc Saltado, tallarin verde con bistec, ceviche and Milanesa de pollo. To be honest, everything was delicious but I really want to comment specifically on the tallarin verde. If you’ve been to other Peruvian restaurants you may notice that some kitchens will dilute the sauce with spinach instead of using mostly basil (may be because of cost?). Sol Inka’s tallarin verde could easily match what my Abuela makes in her very own kitchen - don’t tell her I said that. This is a simple dish, but easy to get wrong. Sol Inka did it right, my tallarin was flavorful and zesty. The steak (bistec) was moist and cooked perfectly.

My Abuela really enjoyed her birthday here, I will definitely be back and hopefully can bring some friends next time to introduce them to Peruvian food done right!<//Text>

Ceviche mixto had no flavor (chef added celery to it big no) Bread was old and hard. Lomo saltado was good. My waitress was nice and attentive but when ask if the restaurant was going to show the soccer world cup in the summer she didn't know what was that event. I might go back just for the bar.<//Text>

<text>This place used to be known as "Mario's" back in the day, but I would say that almost everything is pretty much the same. I generally get the lomo saltado, and the service has been good during the times I have visited Sol Inka. This place can accommodate larger groups, though there might be a little bit of a wait (especially on the weekends). Food quantity is good (comparable or more, relative to other Peruvian restaurants).

Everything was delicious but el Lomo Saltado is the best and the service is great I recommend this place. The portions are big for the price.</text>

The food was decent , the management seems like a nightmare. We ordered an individual plate of one of the dishes and a waitress mistook it for the family size. Needless to say not only did she blame us but told us we had to take it or leave it. Otherwise they would take it out her paycheck, felt bad so we paid. She kept coming back to "check on us" but we felt really uncomfortable with her condescending tone of voice. Needless to say i'll avoid this place , theres definetely cheaper options for peruvian & they dont make you feel weird.< /review>

<response>None</response><Text>Came here for a friend's birthday and walked away with the knowledge that I now know one more decent Peruvian place. I got the Pollo Saltado and it was great. Plenty of chicken too. I was sad the meal didn't come with the normal accompaniment of soup. It was very filling though and was a decent portion .

Their green sauce is spicy as well.

Also, please note they do not service alcohol. They had it on the menu at one time but perhaps they lost or gave up the liquor license.< /Text></record>

The prices are reasonable  $12.00 for big  plate of Lomo Saltado.  The ambiance is nice,  The place is big and has 2 TV 's to watch sports. The service is incredible,  our server's name was Siomara.</Review>

Good place for peeps who like steak how ever they want it and their menu has more to offer than a Mc Donalds meal. Peeps that eat at restaurants other than here are making a big mistake but if they have an alergic reaction never mind. I recommend this restaurant as a 5 star because I've been going for family events.<//review>

Enjoyed a good lunch. Hot bread butter and green aji sauce help fill the wait until our meal arrived. The chupe de camarones was filled with shrimp and was yummy 😋. The chicha morada tasted authentic. Overall a good experience. Plenty of seats for a large party. One of the better Peruvian restaurants in OC.<//review>

I love the food here and the servers are really nice. Food can take a while, especially the soups as they are cooked to order. Portions are very large. The Lomo Saltado is a staple and is pretty speedily made, but I also like the Chicharron de Pollo as it is completely different with its bright lemony dipping sauce. Just be warned there are a lot of bones so you have to be careful when eating it.

For appetizers the calamari was really good and we like to order a side salad as it helps balance out the very carb heavy rice/fries that comes with the saltado plates.

Also soup bowls are huge.<//Review>

Good enough for a quick lunch, their lomo saltado is decent, but a friend didn't feel too hot after eating their marisco saltado. We've been back a couple of times for lunch, though. Overall, not bad.< /Review>

Ordered the saltado de pollo and the portion size was really big, easily enough to share between two people! Love the chunks of chicken sauteed with potatoes, onions, and tomatoes. And only for $12.25! They don't skimp on quantity. And everything tastes delicious.

Complimentary rolls with greens sauce, which is a must-try. It's got a hint of spice. Mmm! Also try the chicha morada drink, which is a Peruvian beverage made from purple corn. There's also hints of cinnamon and clove in the drink.< /text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Dear Mario or your Son (because they told us the son would be upset to hear this)

I drove 45 minutes to get to your restaurant at 7:50pm and Andrea and Alana told me they couldn't seat me and my family because your kitchen that closed at 8pm was closed, however they did allow us to order our food to go when my husband asked them.

While waiting for our food we observed people barely giving their order to servers and people BARELY getting their food. We asked why they couldn't seat us and they kept saying they were closed. There was a group of gentlemen waiting next to us who THOUGHT they were waiting to get seated (they got there before us) and because it was 8:05 when they finally acknowledged them they proceeded to tell them Sorry we're closed and let them walk away (there were 4 of them)

I would think this is very bad business to be having these young ladies manning your fort because not only do they have a terrible attitude they are driving away business from your livelihood.

We asked to speak to a manager and they ignored us a couple times...we asked who the lady was helping out getting the orders out in the back was and they said "Mario's wife" we asked to speak to her and they told us NO that we couldn't?!

They finally brought out a nice man from the back I think his name was Jose and we expressed our concerns and disappointment, he mentioned he is instructed to take food orders up until 8pm...we showed him our to go ticket that showed they sent the order over at 7:55pm. He was very apologetic but really there was nothing he could do (maybe invite us in to eat our to go food would have been great!)
No we weren't looking for free food or compensation in the future..we just wanted good service and your staff failed during the numerous opportunities they had to turn this around. We even heard other people around us say "Yup their food is good..but their service is shitty" I agree your food is good..that's why we drove 45mins to get here...but your service has to be at least mediocre to get us to come back. It's sad...we've been coming since it was Jose Antonio...loooong time ago...but you just lost a long time customer and believe me EVERYONE I know will hear about this experience and I'm sure they will stop coming too.

We ended up eating our food next door at at Mike's Burgers..sad for you that the girl working there even offered us napkins etc..even though we weren't even patrons at that place!  It's called SERViCE.  As of now..we are on the hunt for another Peruvian food place to go to and recommend ourfriends to.<//Review>< Pictures>

You go to a new place to eat, and as far as I am concerned, any dish they put in front of you, actually any edible items, is on kind of a trial. Specially if said place is heavily favorably endorsed, by over 700 reviews. Also cleanliness plays a critical part, for who would want to take a chance in a place that was plagued by unkempt hands. Not saying this about Mario's Peruvian Restaurant, just in general, for hard earned cash regrets being spent on less than reliable, tasty places. Loving with a passion authentic delicious Peruvian cuisine, I decided to stop at Mario's Peruvian Restaurant for the first time.
Let's start by calling Mario's Peruvian restaurant what it is: a sad disappointment in that they call themselves Peruvian, but they do not deliver the quality of food Peru is well known for around the world. Case in point: Choros a la Criolla, $10+ for 6 medium size mussels. The size of these tasty mollusks was certainly not the issue, it was the blunder that arrived to my table. Please allow me to explain: Choros (mussels) are served with a very fresh combination of very fine diced tomatoes, onions (preferably red onions, but not limited), chillies, sparse amount of delicious cilantro, salt, pepper, plus In some parts they add freshly boiled al dente kernels of corn, mixed altogether in a similar, but not quite, as a Pico de Gallo (The delicious Mexican version of fresh salsa), and generally the delicious Peruvian chilies that are unique to Peru (ROCOTO) add a dimension of heat to the mix well worth applauding, but of course milder options are equally tasty. The Mussels are served in the half shell, the salsa described topping each one, and on the side pieces of lemon (limes in the US, as they are comparable in acidity), and people squeezes a few drops of lemon juice to their preference.
What arrived in front of me was a semi frozen mediocre Salsa, smeared to the point of no return with lime juice or something very similar (a cardinal culinary sin, which any Peruvian cook worth their mettle would never commit), for this much lime in an old semi frozen salsa indicated it is not made daily, and for the first time in a long time I sent this overpriced dish back. 1 Star.
Ceviche Mixto, $14, with pieces of mushy fish and other seafood cooked in a citrus based sauce that did not did it any favors, slightly better than the rejected mussel dish. 3 Stars.
Bread, a little passed its prime. Green Peruvian sauce at the table, hot and tasty, made it easy to overcome the warm stale bread. Service no complaints and waiter was properly rewarded for his efforts. Water, acceptable. Lady at the front a revelation of good manners and fine figure. Time was around 12PM on a Friday.
For a place heavily endorsed by many, it did not, by any stretch of the imagination, deserve such glowing accolades, regardless if every other dish in the menu was better, which stands to doubt. 2 Stars.< /Text>

I haven't actually eaten here, but this place used to be Mario's Peruvian restaurant. I got food poisoning from Mario's and then they closed a week later. This place opened up with a week or two of Mario's closing down so I'm not sure if it's the same owner just rebranding itself or a completely new restaurant.<//Review>
