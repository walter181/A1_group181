<text>Can’t say enough about the Aker customer service.  Especially Jake.  A holster that I ordered wouldn’t work on my Sig P320 due to the extra high front sight used when there is a Romeo Red Dot sight used. They sent me a shipping label to return the holster and then went about figuring out exactly what would work.  Once they figured out what would work they manufactured it and sent it to me. It fit perfect, the quality is outstanding, and I couldn’t be more pleased.  I also have a Aker holster for one of my 1911’s which is also a great holster.  No doubt there will be more Aker products in my safe in the future.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1625071379631, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the kind words and detailed review, Gregory!

Being local, I dropped by the factory just to see if they could repair my 20+ year old holster for my P-226. Jake said he would check…and not only could they, but it was done in less than 10 minutes! It still looks new after all these years. That’s quality.</review>< user>

My experience personally I highly recommend this company to anybody needing leather products made my experience was top-notch from beginning to end I could not ask for a better customer service Jake was very personable and helped me very thoroughly with my specific needs and for any of you left-handed people out there that was one of my needs we are not left out this company accommodated me and made me a custom-molded left-handed item that fits my item perfect I feel like I made a friend talking with Jake Long distance over the phone while he was helping me to figure out what I needed and what would fit after I received the product I could not be happier it fits like a glove their work is very very detailed and high quality this is by far the best experience I've had in leather work anywhere even better yet they are American made American owned and a family owned and operated business we should be supporting our local family operated businesses and I am glad I found this business by recommendation again I can't stress enough how happy I am with the item they made for me and like I said above ANY LEFT-HANDED PEOPLE OUT THERE that need leather goods made to fit their specific needs I highly recommend this company check them out give them a call and talk to them if you don't see what you need on their website they will be happy to talk to you and make sure they can do anything they can do to make sure you get what you need if it's within their reach at all I feel like I made a good friend talking with Jake when he was helping me with the customer service part and what I needed he went above and beyond to make sure it was exactly what I needed I could not be more pleased like I said if I had to write this company one to 100 they get a 5000 on my book that's how happy I am don't hesitate to use them you won't be disappointed I promise you<//Review>

<Time>1617828337906</Time><review>I have been a user of Aker products for many years; holsters, belts, ammo, and cuff cases.  I have been a plain clothes officer for over 30 years and like the professional appearance of their real leather products.  As most officers I have a collection of holsters as firearms change, but in all those years have never had an item fail or a snap break.  My current holster is over 6 years old and still in great condition.  I have had to re-die worn places on the holster, but it still fits perfectly and the snap has not failed.  Their reinforced belt easily carries the weight of a 45 caliber Glock< /review><Name>William Conway<//Name>< Pictures>

We love Aker, these guys were super helpful and the customer service is bar none. Jake helped us with finding / replacing a holster. We had some issues and he was quick to help us (more than a few times) and offer a replacement. He even checked in a few days later to make sure that product was working out for us. Again, the customer service was outstanding, the product is great. We are very happy!< /Review>

After ordering, Aker contacted me and asked if I'd be willing to wait 6 to 9 weeks for delivery. I respected them for being upfront about the turnaround time. It didn't take as long as they'd anticipated and I'm very happy with the holster. I'll definitely order from them again and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a custom leather holster.</Review>

<review>Excellent customer service! I needed a holster in a timely fashion. The customer service representative listened to my needs and responded appropriately. They ensured that I received my holster in time for an event that I had even though at the time of purchase they did not have the one I wanted in stock. I am very grateful to them and the entire team at Aker for going above and beyond to ensure I received my holster on time. Because of their great customer, extremely high quality product, and their attention to detail, I will forever be a customer of Aker Leather! Thank you very much! I hope this review reaches the top level management at Aker so that they may be recognized for their excellent work!< /review>< pictures>

I bought a cheap duty belt years ago that was falling apart. Needed a sturdy duty belt urgently, I ordered the velcro lined duty belt (B02V) but the size I needed was out of stock. I contacted the office and spoke with Jake. He came through and helped me out tremendously bumping up the lead time for my order and I had it in my hands a few days later. While I was in the office picking up my order, I also needed to upgrade my handcuff cases. Jake was able to check the inventory and I placed my order right then and there, walked out with exactly what I needed in time for work. Thanks again Jake and Aker for pulling through for me! I really appreciate it!</review>

I had a small problem with one of Aker's belts, I sent in some pictures to a young man named Jake, he rectified the issue, this was done in the course of 24 hours. I am retired Law Enforcement, so as far as leather products, and fast and friendly service I recommend all their products, not just to law enforcement , but to civilians also. They make excellent products,  and they stand behind them .Jake was a miracle worker, it is also a very customer friendly company pleasant to talk to, and no bum's rush to get you off the phone. Thanks Aker....</Review>

<review>I now have three of these magazine carriers, and they are well-designed, well-made, and made of very robust materials.  I can't think of a single thing I would change.

Even the belt loops are smart.  They have inch-wide straps, two of them, on the reverse of each carrier, making it possible to mount them in the conventional belt mount fashion, or, on any MOLLE-compatible gear.

I find this mag carrier very thoughtfully designed and very generously constructed.  I'm very satisfied, and the price is reasonable as well.

(And I promise I'm not just a shill.  I really did form this impression of the mag carriers.  I was kind of amazed.)<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Not only are these the best belts you can buy, their customer service is nothing short of extraordinary. I lost a keeper on one of my Aker belts and I let them know, so I could buy another one.  They just sent me two free of charge - and did so right away.  I have three of their belts and I'm going to buy another one. The only problem with these belts is they last forever! In a time where old-fashioned quality and customer oriented business is going away, it's a pleasure doing business with these folks.<//review>

<text>I have been looking for a concealed holster for my Glock 19 equipped with a Viridian C5 laser/light combo, and the only custom holster I could find was a neoprene job. I really prefer leather holsters since they are much more comfortable for everyday carry. The quality of this holster is first class and the price was very reasonable. Since I order mine shortly before Christmas, it probably took longer than usual to receive, but well worth the wait.  And, due to the wait, they even reduced the purchase price. I own numerous handguns and even more holsters, and this one is as good or better than most.  I only wish they offered it without the thumb break.< /text><date>1611758264476</date>< response>

While the shoulder rig and the snubby revolver holster is GREAT, the accompanying speedloader pouch is WAY to LARGE for the 5 round speedloaders.  They will actually hold 6 round speedloaders loosely.  The problem with this is that a small frame person (who will be using this concealment rig) will have an obvious bulge on the speedloader side (forcing your arm and elbow away form your body.  This rig is useless for me/us, until I can either find a smaller speedloader pouch, or a loose ammo pouch that can be mounted on the off side of this rig.  $155 spent that we can not use yet...< /review>

<Review>I've talked on the phone to Jake at Aker and he is very pleasant to deal with.  Had a few questions and he cleared them up.  I ordered a flatsider XR7 for my two XD's.  It showed up and is just as pretty in person as it is online.  It also matches my brown CCW belt from Aker very well.  Speaking of belts, if you conceal carry, you've gotta try Aker belts.  The one I am wearing right now I have worn daily since 2015. It's held up wonderfully and has a very nice, broken in look.  For fancier affairs, I bought the same belt in both tan and black, and those are my "dress belts."  Overall, I'm very pleased with Aker.  They are a company based out of California, they answer the phone when you call and are responsive to questions, and it's great to know that my money is going to 2nd ammendment supporters who live in the same state as I do.    Lord knows the firearms community could use a couple more friends in California.  Aker gets an A+ from me.<//Review>< username>

The order was processed and product shipped in a timely manner.  The holster I received from Aker appears to be of high quality.  However, it is an EXTREMELY tight fit on my Smith & Wesson 329PD .44 Magnum revolver.  The holster is intended for Smith & Wesson N-Frame revolvers, which the 329PD is, but it is very difficult to get my revolver out of the holster once the gun is holstered in place.  I expect this extremely tight fit may possibly relax with time.  However, the much more significant problem is that the thumb strap is way, way too short to actually wrap around the hammer of the revolver and snap together.  The thumb strap is approximately 1-inch too short.  It is not even close to being able to snap together with the revolver holstered.  I am making efforts to try to stretch the thumb strap, but, given the high quality of the leather that the holster is constructed from, I am not certain I will be able to stretch the thumb strap enough to make it work.</review>

Purchased a duty belt at the beginning of the year and their website was super easy to use. Found the perfect belt for me. Aker also provided great customer service on their online and phone systems. Great quality gear and great service. Will definitely buy from them again directly in the future again!</review>

Great product. I'm a very small person. 5'5" 130 LBS. I have trouble concealing just about anything but this works well with a sport jacket, although I like fitted clothes so I can't button any Jacket the bulge is too obvious, but.. can't blame Aker for that. I don't think any other shoulder holster would even be remotely concealable on someone my size so I'm very happy with it.. Plus, of all the conceal options I've tried this is the quickest draw. Also.. Super comfortable.</text>

I placed an order after talking with the folks at Aker to make sure the duty gear items would arrive by a certain date. Something happened with the carrier causing a delay to the scheduled delivery. I made Aker aware of this and they didn't even ask questions. They just immediately sent new items via "next day air" to make sure they arrived by the date that I needed them. Now THAT is how you earn yourself some customer referrals and a solid review on Google.<//Text>

Generally quite good. Glock 23 very tight fit when holster arrived. Literally five hundred-plus insertions to loosen, and several  over-nights with pistol wrapped in plastic bag in holster. Still tight, but since I'm not into fast-draw competition, the draw is acceptable. Also a very comfortable fit, and much more concealable than any IWB I've used, need for cover garment notwithstanding. Would appreciate two improvements in design: (1)Would be good to have the option of belt tie downs, especially on the pistol side, and (2) as a left hander, I would like to see the mag pouches angles reversed, allowing a single, smooth drop into hand, ready to insert into pistol without having to spin the mag first.
But, again, overall a good and relatively timely service and would probably rate it at 4 ½.  As I heard many times in my forty years as a union carpenter, "Close enough for Government Work".< /review>

I've been using Aker leather products for nearly 30 years. They only use top quality leather and their craftsmanship is second to none. I'm particularly fond of their off duty holsters, mag holders and belts. Weapon retention is top notch, and the attention to detail, like smooth covered snaps is outstanding. I highly recommend the flat sider series, its my go to for any concealed carry situation.</Review>

I would like to thank Aker Leather for their excellent customer service. I contacted the company a few weeks ago to exchange an item that was incorrectly sent to me via a third party distributor. After receiving no help from the distributor, I spoke to Aker employees who without hesitation, exchanged the item for what I needed even though it was not their error.  Aker products are high quality and great looking. Thank you for the outstanding product and great customer service.<//review>

<Text>This holster was made for a S&W mod 586. which is a L frame not a K.  Holster was advertised as fitting but I don't think the manufactures took into consideration the barrel lug.   Tight fit  is fine since leather has to form to the gun.  I put gun in plastic bag and inserted gun.  Thumb break hammer strap was too long.  After unsnapping the long amount of leather did not allow the gun to be drawn.  I had to take a knife and trim down almost quarter inch of leather beyond the snap otherwise the strap would not free itself from the hammer.  Right now not too thrilled with this holster.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80d94c25e52910f1:0x21a7461378efa8be</gmap_id></record>

<Text>I have several Aker holsters, my favorite being the White Lightening belt slide. I have one for my G17/26 and another for my G43. They are used daily and not only are the comforting but also comfortable. I carry from the moment I put my pants on until they come off. I have one Aker holster
That is 20? years old. Still functions and although softened with age, it can still do the job! Great holsters.</Text>< Rate>

< Review>
Aker leather has provided me several holsters over the years which look and perform really well and at a reasonable price.  Now I've tried their dress carry belt and find myself wearing it daily for work even when not using a holster.  It looks, feels and performs better than some of my expensive designer belts.< /Review>

<review>In addition to making an excellent quality product, the staff at Aker Leather provides the same level of customer service, listening to user feedback and following up to see how the product is working out. I started out using Aker products, switched over to the "lightweight" duty rig for some years, and have now come back to using Aker leather. It looks sharper and polishes better than the synthetic leather, and the weight difference is negligible. Thank you!< /review>< pictures>

I have been using AKER LEATHER products since 1982.
As a U.S. Army Infantry Officer stationed in the Republic of Panama from 1982-1984, I had to carry a 45ACP pistol under my uniform shirt and in civilian clothes. Aker products are well made, durable, and affordable.
I have been using AKER LEATHER products for the last 38 years.

I had another review on here which I am writing this to warn consumers about. I bought a holster on Amazon with the name Akar thinking it was Aker. The picture was of a good holster and I thought I was getting a deal. When I got the holster it was a piece of crap and not up to the AKER standard. I called and although it took a bit to get in touch with someone, Ken was understanding. The true Aker holsters are top notch and I know several military members that rave about them. I am in the process of ordering one myself and will follow up in the future. Right now I can only tell what I have heard and speak to the company's customer service which was outstanding with MY mistake.< /text>

<Review>I bought two of Acker leather off duty belts for ccw . Good looks and functionality. The belt is so reinforced yet comfortable ; and it easily handles my S&W N frame 629 3in. Incredible! You could pay $40.00 or more for a dept. store belt but, why would you. This belt is again comfortable, good looks and even gives back support.
Recent order the website malfunction. Ron Acker called me from California (I’m in Pa.) and took my order over the phone. Customer service. Check!
I deal with Midway USA for my shooting needs. I just got done with them concerning a mistake on a recent order. Great customer service. See the trend. I told them at Midway “ You have to check these guys out “
I’ve been in customer service for over 40 yrs. A lot of us may take it for granted. However, Acker leather products are custom made and off the highest quality. So, police officers and civilians alike check this awesome company out. Quality and price!

(Translated by Google) It is a place where funeral services are held, with great respect, and maintaining the custom of covering the head and wearing conservative clothing, in all services. It reminds me of when we, too, covered our heads and wore conservative clothing as a sign of respect for our Church.

(Original)
Es un lugar en el cual hacen los servicios funerarios, con mucho respeto, y conservando la costumbre de cubrirse la cabeza y  vistiendo ropa conservadora , en todos los servicios. Me recuerda cuando nosotros también, nos cubríamos la cabeza y vestiamos ropa conservadora en señal de respeto a nuestra Iglesia.</text>

<review>I called Gt Locksmith to unlock my car door because I left the keys inside. They were quick to show up and unlock my door. But when I talked to the guy on the phone he quoted me $29.99, after the guy unlocked my door he charged me another $300 on top of the $29.99. I feel completely ripped off and had I known it would cost that much from the beginning I would have called another company. It should not cost $329.99 to drive 20 minutes to me and take another 2 minutes to unlock the car.< /review>< gmapID>

Sorry for your experience, I’ll be happy to give you 10% off any service next time if you need. Thank you 😊'}<//response><user_name>Patrick Aldea< /user_name>< time>

<pictures>None< /pictures><user_name>Joshua Amezcua<//user_name><text>So disappointed. We needed our mailbox lock fixed. The guy showed up 45 minutes later than the time he gave. He said it would cost 200 DOLLARS to fix the lock... Then we said no thank you, and he started telling me I owed 30 dollars for him coming out ( never disclosed beforehand). Continued to say no to the replacement and he magically jumped down to 100 dollars, which is still unreal. All he did was rip the lock off with a screwdriver and drill a hole for a little cam lock, which is less than ten dollars at Lowe's. Lesson learned.

If you ever need this done, I suggest buying the lock and avoiding their attempts to swindle you.</text>< Resp>
{'time': 1589639414401, 'text': 'Dear customer if you decide after a very good service to tell the story,tell the full and the right details.we reduced the price by taking off the service call to $170 because we’ve got late (because of the pandemic everything go slow depending on service request ),then you keep asking for more discount because the difficult pandemic time we took it down to $120 which is a big price reduction.then in the 3rd time you ask and begin is to take it down to a $100 or leave.what a shame.as a essential business in this pandemic time we committed to any customer needs and decided to work with you.that’s the only reason you’ve got the job for a $100 lol . So I think we for sure we’re not deserved review like that, because of customers like you we’re getting bad name and I’m sorry we even provide you the service definitely not worth it. You in our record and you definitely not going to get another service from us. Shame on you.'}</Resp>

< review>
Guy is an expert locksmith.  He replaced our front door lock expeditiously, professionally and was so pleasant and helpful with great advice.  The cost was fair and reasonable.  I highly recommend GT Locksmith.  Guy is highly dependable.  Called me when he was on his way exactly as he stated in our initial conversation and arrived on time.  Excellent experience.  I will definitely call Guy for all of our locksmith needs.< /review>

He was very professional and his prices are very reasonable. He changed two locks in a matter of 10 minutes. We recommend him to anyone needing locksmith services. He's awesome!<//text>< user_name>

<text>Called this number cause they are “5 star” and “google guaranteed” and they picked up and told me the nearest “Locksmith” will contact me. A weird number called me and 2 guys showed up really disrespectful even parking in my driveway taking up the whole space like if they owned it. More then one hour passed and they couldn’t opened it even after damaging my door knob. I asked them what was the charge...1st I believe if they didn’t get it open one shouldn’t pay like any other locksmith will say. 2nd he wanted to charge me more then what I was told over the phone 3rd he got all worried when I asked him for a receipt and to top it off the receipt didn’t have any info what’s so ever of who, when, where and cost. It just said “service call” and the amount. I asked him to write the company and he tried playing stupid with me. Worst experience in my life! Missed my brothers graduation ceremony that we waited years for. Oh and did I mention a real locksmith came and before I even turned around to let him do the job he already had the door opened in matter of seconds.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Guy G. Awesome. Definitely would recommend his services for any locksmith needs that you. Professional. Great sense of humor. Rekeyed my locks in less than 15 minutes and ensured that everything was secured and locked. He took the time to double check and lube the rekeyed locks afterwards. A definite. Check him out.<//Text>< Pictures>

I called and told person over the phone . I needed a key made for 1998 Ford F-150 and he quoted me 125 for key and 29.00 for service . When he got their he told me it was going to be 275.00 I told him what I was quoted over the phone and he just kept coming up with excuses why it was more . I had no other choice but to pay since I had been stuck for hours and had to get home . I believe he took advantage of situation to charge more !! Horrible Service ..<//Review>

<Text>I booked the appointment online using their fast booking system on their website, secured a same-day spot in minutes! Asia was a stellar hair artist. I told her as specifically as possible what I would like at the beginning, and she went straight to work, quietly crafting my hair. Clearly knew what she was doing, extremely competent and friendly, and a 30 minute cut -in and out- PLUS  free drink?! What an amazing experience. Never going to a salon ever again. THANK YOU ASIA.< /Text>< pictures>

She's worked with me through fixing a pixie cut my friend gave me in a dorm room, growing out a full buzz cut, evening out an undercut I gave myself, growing out said undercut, layering my longer hair, discovering my hair's natural curl, and indulging my need for an undercut with a perfect selection that strikes a perfect balance between punk and professional. She's got a great eye for cuts that will continue to look good as they grow out. Love her!< /review>< Time>

Just got a low skin fade/disconnect done by Josh. Best experience I've ever had at any barbershop hands down. Josh is the best and provides great conversation during the entire process. Shop is clean and cultured, offering a sly nod to classic barbershops by offering a complimentary beer for you while you wait. 11/10 will be returning. Thanks Josh!< /review>

Good quality cut. I get a different stylist each time and they're all very meticulous. Blue collared prices have gone out the window. Sometimes they offer you a drink.</Review>

My go to spot for a good haircut in the East Bay. Josh does a great job on my hair and really knows his stuff. Their customer service is always friendly, prices are good, and conversation is lively. Make sure to bring cash!<//Text>

Used to enjoy visiting this location. However, the past 3 times I came in I was treated like a burden as a customer. I found a different barber nearby and feel much more respected and comfortable there.< /text>

First timer and now a regular. Got a great haircut from Josh who really took his time and listened to my vague instructions and somehow understood exactly what I meant. They are open late (9pm) which is also a huge plus for those of us that work late. $30 for a haircut is very reasonable when the barber spends an hour meticulously giving you exactly what you want. Nice people, fun conversation and free beer!<//text>

The only way you're going to get a good beard trim here is if you bring a protractor and a sharpie.

Been here 4 times and have come away with two average cuts and two really bad cuts. If they charged ten dollars for a cut this would make sense.<//review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I usually go to Sonia who always gives me an outstanding cut. But she's often booked up. I was in a hurry for a cut before an interview so I went with any available barber there. I got scheduled with Sandra. She cut my hair entirely with a razor. I asked her to use scissors and clippers but she insisted on the razor. The result was a mess, like someone had hacked my hair off with a kitchen knife. When she was finished my bangs were too long. When I asked her to shorten them, she also refused saying time was up. She didn't even bother to brush the hair off my neck when she finished and then charged me for a long cut even though my hair was initially short. I had to shorten my bangs myself at home and cut off some of the hair on the sides with scissors just to make myself presentable for an interview. Next time if Sonia is booked and I can't wait, I'd rather get a crappy ktichen knife cut at Supercuts. At least they don't overcharge for a crappy cut.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Comfy barber shops with great staff, accommodating your needs with hair products and advice aplenty. Free coffee and beer,  a phone call reminder the day before.
I've been coming to both locations for several years and intend to do so for many more.<//text>

<review>The turnover seems to be relatively high here since I never have had the same person. This makes it a bit hard to get the service I expect for a line-up - sometimes I get clippers on the neck and rarely I get a hot shave on the neck, which is what I prefer.</review>< pics>

I really really want to give this barbershop more stars.... the vibe, decor, front desk guy, booze(yes!!!) Deserve 5stars. Even my barber lady gets 5 for being so hot =) but the haircut and more importantly beardcut was sort of a huge let down and butchered my exquisitely lush and overgrown chin mullet with lord nelsoneaque chops. It took 6 months to recover  (to everyones horror)< /Review>

<Review>Takes appointments but is cash only. They do take walk ins, but they you gotta wait. They also give you a drink as you wait. My haircut turned out fairly well and they have dogs to hang out with if you get bored.<//Review>< pictures>

Convenient location and a great haircut by Ben. The staff are incredibly friendly and chatty as well. Between the atmosphere and the inexpensive price, this is going to be a regular.</text>

I started the process of refinancing my home with a little dread thinking I had missed my window for the all around lowest rates ever, that is when I called up Lend US and got a hold of Mr Chase, who picked up right away ready to assist me immediately and do whatever he could to get me those desired rates.
His level of knowledge and customer service skills is unmatched by anyone I have ever dealt with. Even though I am 3 time zones away I could call him or email anytime and he would answer right away ready and willing to help me with any issues I had and if he didn't have the answer right away whatever time it was he would do the leg work and find that out for me.
His willingness to go above and beyond to provide the most spectacular customer service experience ever has me recommending him to my friends and very thankful he was the one I got a hold of at the beginning.<//Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>I had planned to retire and purchase a home based solely on my Social Security income. I connected with Chase a full year before retirement to determine if this was possible. He was so patient with me, answering my repeated questions and assuring me he could get me funded. Indeed he did! Chase was always on hand to guide me and assure me that everything was working out as expected. He called me many times in the evening, way past working hours, to give me updates. Chase was able to get me into my current home, where I intend to live out my retirement years. I cannot speak highly enough of his customer service and his attention to my every question. Thank you, Chase!!<//Text>< Rating>

This was our first time refinancing our home, and I’m so glad it was with Chase. My family and I were originally going to go with our original lender, but after a friend referred us to Chase (and told us that he had awesome rates) we didn’t look back. Our original lending company was a Big box type organization— long hold times to get to an agent, and having to play phone tag to get on their business hours. Working with Chase was a totally different experience. He was responsive via email and phone calls, and attentive with every single question and concern that we had. It was an obvious choice to go with Chase— especially because his rates were better than our original lender. Moreover, Chase’s communication throughout the process was professional and exactly what we were looking for. Chase’s detail oriented style was in line with my husbands, and the big picture summation of everything that needed to get done and checking in to tell us where we were in the process was in line with my communication style. Overall, we had an absolutely wonderful experience working with Chase and would highly recommend anyone wondering if they should refinance to talk to him. You’ll be impressed, just as much as we were, at how painless and easy the process was with Chase.</text>

Now I have to rave about him! It was seriously the easiest experience ever. I’m sure he was busting tail behind the scenes to get things done but very little was required of us, and he was always incredibly responsive to any questions- which is even more impressive given that we live 2 time zones away.  Him and his brother Hunter locked us in a historically low rate at the last minute (because I’d procrastinated the refinancing).  My husband is a veteran and Chase/Hunter were very knowledgeable about VA loans, giving us great advice on how to use ours now and in the future.  Chase is a great communicator, very personable and even more importantly he delivers.  If I’d know the process was going to be this easy I wouldn’t have procrastinated.  In the future I will use him when we decide to purchase another home.  It doesn’t matter what state you’re purchasing/refinancing in- Chase and Hunter got you!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Chase was beyond helpful to us as first time home buyers. He explained everything in a very detailed way and never made me feel stupid for asking questions. He also got me an unbelievable rate and other lenders were telling me to go with him because they couldn’t do better. 10/10 recommend.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I highly recommend Senior Loan Advisor Chase Zinkil. He helped me refinance my home in Hawaii and I was able to trust him with this. He gave me very useful advice about refinancing my home and he was able to get things finalized and processed pretty quickly. On top of my funds getting approved, I'm able to rest from my mortgage bill on a 2 month break before continuing my new refinance payment. Thank you Chase for your wonderful and professional work. God bless, Melania Leao.< /Text></record>

<review>Chase was amazingly patient, diligent and detail oriented. I explained my lack of knowledge and right away Chase went into mentor mode and took care of everything! I never once felt as if he was trying to steer us in a direction that was not comfortable or unsensible towards our needs.
He made sure we understood everything we were doing thruout the whole process and when we asked questions he never turned them away but instead helped us to learn and completely understand what we were getting ourselves into prior to any agreements made.
That alone says alot, now a days!
Not too mention Chase's availablity to ensure your happiness and comfortableness is priceless!
I highly recommend Chase Zinkil!
Thanks Chase!< /review>< resp>

If I could give Chase and his team 20 stars I absolutely would. Chase is an incredible and extremely knowledgeable lender to work with. We researched several lenders before we began our transaction, and nobody came close to beating the rate that Chase was able to give us. With this being our first refinance, we did not know what to expect during the process. Chase went above and beyond to ensure all of our questions were answered and that our transaction went as smoothly as possible. Because of Chase and his team, we felt confident throughout the entire process.
HIGHLY recommend!!<//Text>

<text>For the second time we took advantage of the IRRL and refinance with Chase Zinkil at Lend US.  The process was smooth and Chase kept us informed on the entire process and the timelines. He is truly a professional and his experience in the field makes all the difference.  He delivers on what he says he will do!!!!! Thank you, Chase!!<//text>< pics>

When I decided to refinance my home back in Hawaii a few years ago, Chase Zinkil contacted me out of the blue to see if he could help me.  I asked him so many questions and he provided with helpful information.  I refinanced my home with him and he made us feel at ease every step of the way.  He even went out of his way to make our lives easier with the entire process and we were able to close our loan with him getting us a very good interest rate.  Chase has handled complex mortgages and works tirelessly to give his customers his 100+ percent effort.  Whenever I have home loan questions, Chase is the man to go to.  He's by far the one person we trust and you can count on him to give it his all.  Chase Zinkil, you're our number one choice.  If you are thinking of purchasing, refinancing, etc., give Chase a call.  You won’t be sorry.< /review>

I cannot tell you how many mortgage brokers or lending institutions we tried, and all of them turned us down.  We were ready to give up.  One day, I received a call from Mr. Chase Zinkil as he had found out that we were trying to refinance.  I explained that we had been turned down by many brokers, but he said he would like to give it a try.

Mr. Chase Zinkil went to work and he never gave up.  After a month of trying to get the house refinanced on our terms and interest rate so low, he was able to do it.  I couldn’t believe it!  I am highly recommending Lend US and Mr. Chase Zinkil.  He will go the extra mile and he will not give up.

<text>Appreciation!

I am letting everyone know that if you decides to refinance your house for whatever reason, I would highly, highly recommend that you use Mr. Chase Zinkil To represent you In selling or refinancing your home.  You see Mr. Chase has helped me twice within a Year at lower rates each time saving me a substantial amount of money.  He’s the most professional and knowledgeable person I have ever met online.  Mr. Chase will keep you up to-date and informed on what’s going on with your documents on a day by day basis.  Mr Chase works with the escrow office to insure there are no surprises or changes in the outcome that you expect on your refinance. It’s really nice to know that there’s someone out there knowledgeable and trustworthy and you never have to leave your home, knowing Mr. Chase handles everything.

Very respectfully

Chase was incredibly professional and ensured I was updated every step of the way. During a hectic period where I had to travel for work, we were still able to close with the lowest interest rate I have ever had on any loan, within one month from initiating the refinance. He was always clear and concise in what he needed from me and deadlines for each for us to be able to close quickly. Chase projected the kind of customer service and professionalism of a seasoned mortgage expert and I can not recommend him highly enough. I am truly satisfied with the service and result of conducting business with him and LendUS!<//Review>

<Review>When I was struggling with home refinance and my friend send Chase’s contact to me. After few minutes call I know he is absolutely knowledgeable and professional people I met in this field. Because this is my first time do refinance I was unfamiliar with all the details but Chase helped me and solved all my questions. Also even I need help after work hour he still pick up the phone call and patient answer my question. Finally my loan funded and he did his best to let me get best rate, everything went so smooth, I am so lucky I met Chase, definitely gonna refer more and more friend to him. A+++</Review></record>

< Review>
Chase is nothing short of excellent. As first time buyers in Southern California, the home buying process can be daunting. Your dealing with a market so competitive, that as I first time buyer your looking to spend around 500k on a starter home. So you want to make sure you find the right team to handle this process. Chase was not only transparent every step of the way but he went above and beyond to explain the smallest details. He always reassured us when we had questions. Chase worked day and night to close our escrow within 30 days. His phone app, allowed us to see our Loan process along the way and helped give us 24 hour access to documents. Chase worked really hard to not only find us the lowest interest rate possible but found us lender credit that helped with closing cost! If you are looking for a guy who will work hard for you every step of the way and knows what he is doing, look no further cause chase is your guy!<//Review>

I had a great experience refinancing my mortgage (VA loan) with Chase. He was super helpful and accessible, on hand to explain any aspect of the paperwork and process. He was also keenly aware of what was happening day-to-day with rates to time it right and get us some huge savings. Highly recommended.</Text>

To begin, Chase Zinkil knocked it out of the park. I was fairly comfortable with my mortgage payment and rate; when I read that it might be possible to drop it further.
I contacted Chase through LendUS and was immediately impressed by his energy and confidence. He helped point me in the right direction and assisted in accumulating the refinancing documents. My overall experience is just shy of a miracle. I now have a significantly lower monthly payment and a great friend in Chase Zinkil.
Thank you Chase and the team at LendUS!</Text>

<Text>The more you give the more you get, LendUS is all about giving! Mr. Chase Zinkil the loan officer who facilitated the refinance on my home is not the person to make you feel belittled for asking a stupid question and understands veterans as if he was one himself. I’m grateful to have had the privilege to work with a genuinely honest respectful businessman and company. Who have significantly helped my family and I save minus the stress of wondering if we were getting the best deal available. The smoothest process I have ever encountered with any mortgage company by far. LendUS is the best mortgage company I have ever worked with hands down.</Text>< username>

Everything happened super fast and he was extremely communicative along the way. I was so happy I got 4 of my friends to refinance with him as well.

We were recommended to Chase from a friend who used him and we are definitely glad we did.  Chase was an absolute professional who went above and beyond to ensure our loan experience was easy and simple for us.  We always received quick reply’s even when we emailed him at 1am, this guy never took a break!  He answered every question we had and ensured we knew exactly what was going on.  We have had 7 home loans/re-fi’s in the past 20 years and Chase was hands down the best loan officer we have had.< /text>

Chase right from the start had my vote of confidence with the first phone call. I had gotten a lot of phone solicitations in the past and all sounded like just another cold call however there was something different about Chase and what he had to say. There was no pressure just a genuine knowledge of facts that certainly fit our situation. I wanted to maintain an interest rate which I had been told by others was un realistic. Chase without hesitation said he could probably get that for us and he did just that. Chase took on our  not perfect situation in stride and worked his magic. He gave us a timeline and everything happened accordingly. Chase had made the refinance experience a pleasure, yes I said “a Pleasure”. He was always available by phone with which he repeatedly said,”call anytime”. Seems I always caught him at dinner or lunch and he would graciously take my call. Every problem that we hit Chase with rolled off his back and at no time did I ever loose confidence in his knowledge and ability to see our project through to the end. As far as the future goes, we have plans and I just hope Chase will always be available to take on our dreams to come.  Thank you Chase and I still owe you a beer next time we are in So Cal< /text>

From beginning to end of our refi Chase was on top of every issue. He managed to secure for us the lowest rate possible in many years. He made certain we had a painless closing, including switching title companies when the original choice was asking for information already available at another title company. Finally, even after our closing he has continued to answer our questions regarding the rules regarding VA loans. I can highly recommend him to everyone.</Review>

UPDATE in September 2020:  You will not find a more dedicated Loan Officer than Chase Zinkil. We bought a home on a jumbo VA late last year. Chase answered my emails and texts, 24/7 within hours, day and night and weekends and holidays. He got me the best possible rate I could get at the time, and made it so easy for me since I'm not loan-savvy. Last month, he reached out to me for a refinance. We just closed on it last week. It cost me $0 to refinance. No exaggeration. $0. I dropped $700+ off of my monthly payment. I'm actually getting a couple hundred dollars refund check on the refinance. I never left my house. I provided all signatures on my laptop, and he sent the notary to my front porch to wet sign everything. If rates continue to drop, I will refinance again with him in a heartbeat. I'm saving hundreds of thousands of dollars with Chase over the life of the loan. The guy is the best, hands down. Regards, Lieutenant Colonel J. "Lumpy" Lumbaca, US Army (Retired).

Original Review from December 2019:  5-star, superior service and performance from Chase Zinkil at LendUS.  Six months a friend who had mortgage experience with LendUS, and had nothing but great things to say about Chase, referred us to him.  I reached out to him, and from day one he has been nothing but professional, patient, responsive, and worked day and night to secure us an amazing rate on a VA loan.  (Note:  he literally worked day and night, answering my texts and emails within minutes, from several time zones away).  Unlike my normal banks which were slow to respond, Chase provided a very personal touch to the entire process, from our first conversation through closing.  He is extremely well-tuned to the market, and advised me when he believed was the best time to lock in a great rate.  My family and I are truly appreciative of him, his staff, and all that they did for us.  I’ve owned a few homes over the years, but I am quite uninformed regarding mortgage matters.  Chase went above and beyond what one would expect from a loan officer to explain everything to us in terms that we could understand, so that in the end we were able to make the best decisions for our home purchase.  I cannot give him high enough praise, and he will absolutely be our go-to agent in the future should we have mortgage or re-financing needs.   – Lieutenant Colonel J.C. “Lumpy” Lumbaca, US Army (Retired)< /text>

<review>Standard public parking structure. Only issue is that when I pulled in I asked the attendant where the bike station was. She had no clue. Turns out it's right next to that very entrance. I couldn't see it from my car when pulling in and wanted to know so I could park accordingly. What a great service the bike station is!< /review>< gmap_id>

Private Car Storage really lives up to their excellent reviews. Needed short term storage for a vehicle and we live out of state, so I had to pull all this together over the phone/email. Everyone I spoke with went out of their way to make the experience seamless from receiving the vehicle from a towing company, arranging to have a flat tire repaired, and arranging for us to pick up the vehicle on a holiday. Top notch service. Highly recommend!!</text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>We went to a well known car rental company near LAX and it was so shady. They offered us a much more expensive rate than what we saw online with a bunch of extra fees. Luckily my bf found Travel car. We were a little skeptical in the beginning given a much lower price compared to other companies. However, we took a leap of faith to try it out. From the moment we got there til we returned the car the whole process was very easy and convenient. They even provided us with free Lyft back and forth to the airport. No hidden fees or any bs. This is a great deal and we would def use them again in the future!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>Wet well maintained. This is the place you should play tennis. You will be motivated always 25 courts totally and always staff will help you to reserve courts. Don’t go on Wednesdays! One hour waiting mostly evening after 6 pm.< /review>< pictures>

The facilities are great but the people they have put on to manage and allocate the courts are very rude and unreasonable.

Everytime I come here they make you wait inspite of empty courts. Then they also you wait for your partner.

They have very old style way of checking courts.</Text>< Name>

<review>Absolutely remarkable tennis facility. By far, the nicest and cleanest facility I have ever been to. Unfortunately, the lights shut off promptly at 10pm. Aside from that, there are plenty of electrical outlets, meaning a lot of use of the Tennis Machine, there are water fountains, light switches outside every court, and even warning lights so you know when the lights are about to shut off on you. The parking lot is a bit far from the courts. But besides that, the nicest facility I have been to. Highly highly recommend.</review></record>

<Text>The courts are newly finished and very well put together. The shades in the middle of the courts are great, as well as the 4 outlets under the shade by the benches. Easy to access with plenty of parking even on a busy Saturday. So many courts you're bound to find an open one.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcc2b4e3492033:0xec500914c7e75338< /gmapID></record>

<Text>I ordered a Boba tea. The drink itself was good, but the tapioca pearls were disappointingly bland. They lacked any sort of sweetness whatsoever. My guess is that they were stored in plain water rather than a sugar syrup like most Boba places would use. That could be a simple improvement to implement.

Also, just glancing at the yogurt toppings on display, the various candy coated m&m type toppings were white and chalky like they were either old or weren't stored properly. It didn't look particularly appetizing. Seems penny-wise but pound-foolish for a yogurt shop to have stale toppings on display like that.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The Fro-yo part of the shop is dirty and the fro-yo is watery most of the time. The service is really slow. The girls that work there act like they're doing you a big favor to wait on you.< /Review>

Not only do they serve frozen yogurt, but they also have sandwiches and shave ice!

There were six flavors of froyo when I dropped in:

* Vanilla - How can you go wrong with this one?
* Blood orange (non-dairy) - Couldn't really taste the blood orange part...
* Red velvet - Good, but not a big fan of red velvet froyo
* Banana - Don't like it, didn't try it!
* Pina colada - My favorite, more coconut than pina colada
* Chocolate - Also good.

Love the painted Hawaiian mural on the wall. The servings are gigantic too! A small will cost $3, but is large enough to share for two. Easily.< /text>

<Time>1574027018811< /Time><text>My go to carwash. I usually get the "Super Delux" wash. Includes vacuum, wash n dry, wax, amour all on the tires, and air freshener of your choice. They do a great job here and leave your car like it was brand new. Easy to do just pull up for service and let the detailers handle everything. They have a snack and handimart inside if you need any food or novelties for your consumer wants. Friendly service.< /text>< rating>

I've only been to Twinkle Twinkle. Since this asks me to rate the whole center, I only say it's ok because the parking lot is small, so if it were really busy it's hard to find parking in a one-way lot.<//text>

We visited Olivia's Doll House for a Girl Scout outing. The girls had a good time and I was pleased to see they have done some interior updating since our last visit.</Review>

<Review>I was having an issue with my AC where there was a pretty bad smell coming out of it. I wasn't sure what the issue was so I called and they seemed nice and really cared about the issue. They were able to get me in within 2 days which was a lot better than a couple other companies I called. He was professional and adhered to all the Covid protocols. He thoroughly inspected the AC and I didn't get the feeling that he was just there to make some quick money and get out. After about 90 minutes of work it seems like the problem is fixed. I appreciated the honesy from them and their quotes were a lot more reasonable than some of the really big companies I talked to. I will for sure work with them in the future.<//Review><Date>1622896331906< /Date><rate>4< /rate>< Pictures>

They "listen" to your concerns and then develop an "Action" plan ( yes pun intended)  to service , you the customer's needs.

Our HVAC system is over 17 years old thus we needed expert advice and inspection of our system.   With a forecast of a major heat wave in the next few days, it was impairative to have the system serviced.  Steve came out and spearheaded the plan.

Brandon followed up, both by email and via the telephone, scheduling our service for the very next day!

Kyle responded and performed the inspection and service.  He was very honest and professional, never  attempting to "upcharge" us for any unnecessary repairs.  He even reached out to Brandon to discuss the system's status, which both gentlemen concluded was in fine shape for its age.

Kyle showed us his findings and gave our system a thumbs up for the upcoming summer season.   He reassured us that if we have any problems in the near future, Action will respond in a timely manner!

Both Steve and Brandon are aware, when we replace our HVAC system, Action is our choice!

Thank you all very much!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Eduardo serviced our A/C system and did a great job. Checked and explained everything as he went. Recommended installation of a surge protector, which we had him install. Changed the HEPA filter and verified that the drain pan liquid overflow switch was working properly. All in all, we were very pleased with his service. As such, we renewed our service contract for another year.</Review><user_name>Jim Ketterer</user_name><user_id>105587865410878819958</user_id>< time>

<pics>None</pics><response>None</response><Review>My experience with Action Air has been consistently positive.  Today was a good example.  The technician was polite, efficient and professional.  He asked me if I had any questions after he was finished.  Another thing I appreciate is that Action Air calls me to let me know when their technician is on their way in the time window they give me.  They also send a picture of the technician with the “on the way”
message.  This is a great security feature so you know who to expect at your front door.<//Review>< Name>

Our technician Majid, was early, polite, professional, smart and most importantly didn't try to sell me on a new AC system, which some guys with white gloves had attempted to do, when I had them provide their annual Tune Up.  He showed me why we needed he part he installed, which was reasonably priced. They did such a good job I signed up for the two times a year service plan. I've spent close to 40 years in the residential real estate business, and finding a contractor I can refer to my friends and clients is not easy.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dbfe36c3b7a2c7:0x8e10768a0238d2b9< /Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< date>

I hade Majid come out to replace my filters.  He did a great job.

Unfortunately he was unable to fix what another Action Air associate did.  My heater is still installed at an angle.  He said he would let his manager know that an intalation person would need to come out and correct it.

So far, it has been a week and I have not heard from Action Air.

Not real happy at this point!< /Review>

<text>Justin did a wonderful job showing us the numbers and answered all our questions. Action called when they said they were going to call and the timeframe for the project was exactly what they said it would be. The installers (Sean, Sam, and Gilbert?) showed up on time both days and kept us in the loop about everything going on. They wore shoe covers and taped down tarps to protect our wood floors. The company practice is seamless and dialed in. We were very happy with the service and would highly recommend them to anyone!</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I had a routine annual inspection. My two A/C units and one heating unit were all insoected and  monitered for performance. Four filters were replaced and both outside A/C units were hosed off for peak performance. An evaluation of the inspection was given to me  at the end of the inspection.  Couldn't ask for anything more than that...  I have used Action Air for 20 years and  have always been very impressed with the quality of their work.  An outstanding company.< /review>

This was a routine service call, in a day and age where there is no longer anything “routine” about a service call. Shocked! Imagine, on time as promised, full explanation of what he was seeing and recommending, and the cost to perform the recommended service.
In no time, filter replaced, surge protector installed on the furnace and air conditioning. Then, even though the only mess he made was 2 small boxes and some play wrappers, he cleaned up and was finished.
Great guy, if only more companies had great employees like this!</review>

I’ve been using Action Air for more than 25 years and have always been more than satisfied with them. Their response to my requests are professional and friendly. All of their Service Techs are on time, or early, and are quite knowledgeable and happy to explain what they did and what needs further work, if anything.

Action Air will continue to provide all my heating and air conditioning needs.

<text>I was very impressed with action Air Conditioning & Heating.  Their estimator was thorough, so that I knew exactly what I was going to get.  Their office team sent me updates and reminders.  Their installers were right on time.  This was exceptional.  The installation team worked steadily throughout the day.  I didn't see any of them wasting time.  I was so impressed that I have referred them to an additional job.  I would definitely use them again should the need arise.<//text>< Pictures>

<user_id>102212670199402614470<//user_id><response>None< /response><Text>Major our technician was great and went above and beyond the service he provided. My issue is with Action Air as a company and it’s sales policy. After Majid’s inspection, he recommended that we install a surge protector to safeguard our furnace and AC unit. This would prevent the system from becoming overloaded and damaged in the event of a power surge or outage. I asked him why this wasn’t included in the initial build of our package seeing as how it would protect or $15,000 system from damage. Keep in mind, the AC system is not warranted due to power surge damage. Majid was super helpful but directed me to the service department.

I called the service department and was helped by the service manager, who explained that they have been trying to ask the sales department to include it within the initial AC build but they continue to refuse. Their reasoning is that,.... “there are too many add ons to present to the customer.” Also, they purchase the system through a manufacturer who does not offer a surge protector. But Action Air sells the system, and the surge protector, and the warranty. Hmmmm

This is my perspective (which means nothing). When you purchase a car you probably buy every warranty with the vehicle or the warranties that matter. Since my family is investing a LOT of money in this AC system I might want to purchase something that has umbrella coverage for the warranty or some small device that will protect it from an event that is not covered by the warranty?

The surge protector= $300, our AC system= $15,000+, our monthly maintenance warranty $13, Action Air’s response= PRICELESS (I’m being sarcastic).

Overall, I wish Action Air would change their policy or devote some attention to getting their sales and service departments to work together and provide the amazing level of customer service that I received from Majid.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Germane and Tyler arrived well within the proposed time window and went straight to work cleaning and testing all components of my air conditioning system.  Though they found several minor issues, they recommended replacement of only one item that would save energy and might even cause damage to other parts of the system. Germane covered all my options simply and in layman’s terms and suggested items required to fix and recommended items to defer. Very friendly, efficient service while remaining professional at all times.

Following up on the AC service last spring, Majid serviced the heating portion of my HVAC system this October. He arrived well within the time window, and thoroughly checked out every component on my heating unit. He was very knowledgeable about my unique furnace brand and assured me our unit was in great condition and was ready for Winter.

Overall, I’m very happy with Action and highly recommend them for all your heating and solar needs.<//text>

<date>1610145953471<//date><rating>5<//rating><review>Nov 6, 2020  Today was a Scheduled Servicing and an install of 2 surge protectors on each Unit. Rajid did a very Professional job. He wore Mask n Gloves to Protect me. Thank  You Rajid for a Job Well Done. Everything was explained clearly and well.

Action Air is the top notch BEST. All the workers and people you come into contact with are knowledgeable and so very courteous. All are concerned that everything is right, and that you are satisfied with the work that is performed. LOVE Action Air Conditioning & Heating of San Diego. Thank you Juan Perez, it is welcoming to see you when you come to do the Maintenance on our 2 units. Twice now Juan Perez has been here to do the scheduled maintenance and it is good to have the same friendly Tech come back. Keep up the GREAT work Action Air. MYbad for not remembering all the names of the Guys that put in this Monster System we have. Our House is complicated, and the job took 6 days, Mon thru Sat. The Lennox Units are top quality, and so Super Efficient that when Juan comes to do the check, the Start up Amps don't register until he resets his checking tool thingy. Ours registers at 2, normal or more non-efficient units measure at 120. (This is what I learned today, and I am not versed on the technical  name).  Ours has a wifi thermostat, that I could not get to work so gave up. Today Juan and I got both units up to snuff. Awesome. Pic is the week of the install.< /review>< Pictures>

I felt the technician made every effort to honest and clear about what he was doing, what I needed to have done, and what the cost would be.
Also, he left me a flyer about their “Action Rewards Club” but didn’t pressure me at all to join. But rather he briefly explained it, and said if I read it and then was interested, to give them a call & signup.
I was thinking oh no, here’s the sales pitch & pressure, but nope - he said read it at your leisure. I was so relieved.
And to top it off, my air conditioner works again! 👍🏻😄< /Review>

From day one, which goes back several years, we have found Action Air to be an ethical, straight-forward, professional and trustworthy company that provides expert installs and service at a reasonable cost.

Today, it was just for the annual maintenance check on our air conditioner.  The service tech was Thomas, who has been here a number of times for both heating and air conditioning needs.  Thomas is a expert and professional who likes people and gets satisfaction from servicing customers needs and educating them at the same time.  He is most knowledgeable and has excellent people skills.  Consequently, he is a tremendous asset to Action Air and has the abilities to advance within Action Air.  Please let Thomas know that we think highly of him and give him the credit he deserves.<//text>

This the my second time that Action Air performed maintenance on my heating unit and Majid did an excellent job in explaining how he cleaned the blades on the furnace fan.  He also evaluated that a new thermostat that I recently installed may be faulty.  His information allowed me to received a replacement thermostat from the manufactuer.<//text>

I have only good things to say about Action Air from beginning to end. I have never used the company before, however, recently  our air conditioning system stopped working properly. I called Action Air as they are local and got good reviews. I am happy to say those good reviews are well warranted. I received a ONE HOUR window and our technician, Luis, called at the beginning of that window and was here within ten minutes of his call. He was polite and listened to the issues and questions my husband had about our system. He seemed to know the problem right away and proceeded with the repair. He was done within an hour and our air conditioning system is now working properly. I will definitely use Action for any future needs and would highly recommend them to anyone who asks!</review>

<review>Action Air is a wonderful, thorough and professional company. They sent David to perform my annual inspection on my new heater.  He found an area of concern and reported out to the company, who authorized the repair without hesitation and without any charge.  David came back and quickly and expertly corrected the issue; and even cleaned everything up before leaving. I really appreciate Action Air and their attentive employees!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< userid>

David Green came and replaced the old filter in my heater with a new one.   He arrived right on time, was pleasant and proficient.   I am once again very impressed with Action Air and the way you quickly respond to my HVAC needs!    Good job David!</review>

< Review>
Very happy with Raphael and his team with Action AC for their new AC installation at my home. They explained everything, including my needlessly technical questions, quickly installed the compressor, air handler, filter, power, and drainage, tested the system (surprisingly quiet!), and explained next steps, all within about 6 hours. Great job!<//Review>

Arturo Rivera was sent to my home for my 6 month check up for my air conditioner.  After arrival Arturo promptly went to work.  He is quite friendly, & knowledgeable on the different types of payment contracts. I found this refreshing. Arturo Rivera should be commended for his work and attitude.  Arturo is a definite asset to Action Air!< /review>

Bill is an exceptional  technician!!  He’s fast, knowledgeable and is more than willing to spend time with you if you have questions about your unit and/or  thermostat.
For what he did, I thought the price was fair. The last person who came out wanted a $1000 and told us we were going to need a new unit in a few months. Our unit is old and will need to be replaced. However, our problem now was a clog hose that was fixed in a matter of minutes!!
Thank you Bill 🙏🏽</Text>

Horrible! Do not use this company! At first they were associated with Costco but we went with the company on their own. Mistake. About an hour and a half into it a worker stepped on the fire sprinkler in the attic and we now have extensive damage and extreme stress and inconvenience in our home! Drywall, carpet and tile damage due to flooding. Ridiculous! Stay away.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>So glad I went with Action Air to repair our AC unit. The contact center was incredibly nice and helpful and got an appointment for us pretty quickly. Our technician Bill was great! He was professional, friendly and PATIENT with ALL of our questions, mainly repetitive, figured out quickly assessed what was wrong with our unit and was honest and upfront with cost. He also explained the benefits of having annual maintenance without being pushy or upsell-y about it. Truly expressed the importance of the service and we’re so glad we did! It’s important to feel comfortable with technicians in your home and I felt like Bill did an awesome job of doing that. Like a friend coming over to help fix your home!  I’d recommend Action Air in a heartbeat! So glad I remembered seeing your trucks in our complex and that we chose you!<//Review>< pics>

Thomas was very friendly and professional. He did not take long to find out why my air conditioner was not working, and had the parts to repair it right on his van, no waiting or crazy up charges! He offered me good advice on avoiding the problem I had in the future and gave me an option, was very helpful and I was impressed with how cool he was for being booked all day long on a Saturday and it was 90 degrees in the morning! Highly recommend action air and Thomas was great!!! Thomas you are "the man", thanks!<//Review>

Arturo Rivera was the service tech who came for our AC tune-up.  A very polite and personable young man who handled the task professionally.  Our scheduled time frame was 10:30-12:30.  He arrived about 10:45.  He explained what he was going to check, asked for the location of the AC unit and outdoor fan, and proceeded to the task.  He finished in about 45 minutes, flushed out the outdoor fan assembly, ran over the checklist of items he covered, and explained the maintenance plans that were available.  A very well done job!  My wife and I have been thrilled with the performance of our heating/AC unit and the low utility bills.<//review>

This was a complimentary one year maintenance check on our new Air Conditioning system. I was expecting a very basic look around since it was free but was pleasantly surprised of how thorough this check up was. Luis went right to work. Terrific young man that is professional and personable. A trait not seen much these days.</Review>

<review>Technician Bill Sanford had to completely disassemble our old unit in order to gain access to the part that needed to be replaced.  I mean cut multiple copper pipes, remove the whole coil, and then weld everything back in once he was finished.  With no access to fix later every solder joint had to be perfect.  This guy is super pro.  Thanks Action Air!< /review>< pics>

Juan was on time, very friendly and knowledgeable.  He was willing to help with other questions that I had, and explained what he was doing when asked.  I have had very positive experiences with the technicians that have come out for the check-ups on our system.  I recommend him and the company.< /Review>

We had German from action air clean our vents after a major tile install. The condo was a rental before we bought it so God knows what was already in the vents since construction.
During the tile job sweep up, we saw a fine coating of white death everywhere...
German vacuumed, air blasted, cleaned the vent covers and installed new filters.
Here’s to better breathing!</Text>

<review>Bill is a tech for Action Air and he is excellent! He came to my business to do an analysis of several of our HVAC units. His attitude was “what can we do with what you have and how can we extend the life of the older units?” There was none of the typical, “Oh these units are shot! You should look at replacing!” Very refreshing to have that mindset from my HVAC vendor! Highly recommend Action Air!< /review>< Pics>

I have been pleased with the service we've received since our AC & heating system was installed 10 years ago. Due to the routine maintenance performed twice a year, we have had excellent performance.  The technician,  David G. was very knowledgeable and professional.  I'm extremely happy that we chose Action Air.</Text>

Our air-conditioner went out during the latest heat wave and we were desperate to find someone to come out and fix it not just for our comfort, but for our elderly cat who we were very concerned about. Even though Bill was incredibly busy he took the time to call me back on a Sunday and come over to help us. He very quickly and professionally diagnosed our issue as a capacitor problem and had the part to instantly fix it. We had cool air blowing within a half hour of his arrival. He was honest, extremely capable and quick. We could not be more grateful to Bill and Action Air for rescuing us from the tremendous heat! Would highly recommend to anyone needing emergency service and we will be following up to get regular maintenance from Action Air as well because we were so impressed.< /review>

He was on time, even had "booties" to walk on our carpet with!  He worked efficiently and explained the results of the check up (our unit is working well).  Professional but friendly.

We have worked with three Action AC team members so far and each of them was very personable, professional, and knowledgeable. They were very respectful of our house and household members (including our dog 👍🏼) while they were at our house. We are planning to have more HVAC work done in the future and will definitely use Action AC again.< /Text>

Thomas was helpful, courteous, took his time and solved our problem quickly.  We only needed a band aid on an old AC system without spending a fortune and that's what we got. We will buy and have Action Air install our new system in the next several months.
Thank you to Thomas and Action Air!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Chris arrived first to clean the ductwork, then the crew came to replace my unit. I was surprised at how well the crew worked together, they were a true team, were professional, respectful to me and to each other, and knew what they were doing. Chris even stayed after the ducts were cleaned to help the crew move the heavy unit. They finished their work timely and left everything clean. They made sure everything was working and made sure I know how to use my new heating/air conditioning unit.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>While my overall experience with Action Air was fair, they left the job site dirty (dangerous for my dog if he would have eaten some sharp piece of metal) and the quality of finishing work was lacking. Also, something I was originally quoted was removed last minute in what I would say was a deceptive manner. While it's my fault I missed it this action seemed shady and not the kind of customer service I would hope for.

Edit: I was told a group of mangers wanted to come out, after your company disrespected my home I don't feel like having a bunch of you out. I did let Larry my sales rep know that he could come out but did not take me up on the offer.</text><rate>2< /rate><Date>1544559054848<//Date>< Pictures>

Action was very responsive to my service request and scheduled an appointment without difficulty or long wait.  Our service technician, Thomas, was very friendly and helpful.  He took the time to explain what he was doing and why.  I would definitely call Action again next time I have a HVAC issue.<//text>

<Text>As the heat in Ramona recently shot up, our AC system touch screen thermostat went blank so we could not turn on the AC.  Action Air Conditioning sent out a very experienced Tech named Bill who was able to quickly diagnose the problem and had the parts to get the AC up and running again.  Pretty Cool trick.

<Text>We had our entire HVAC system replaced by Action Air Conditioning & Heating and we are very happy with the work they did.  The salesman who initially visited us, Larry S., was very knowledgeable about the products his company used and the process involved in installation.  The installers who did the actual work, Ruben and Antoine, were very courteous and professional.  They listened to our concerns, completed the job in a timely manner, went over the manuals with us, and made sure that all traces of the work were cleaned up before they left each day.  We highly recommend this company to anyone seeking work on their HVAC system.</Text><Name>Doris Christopher<//Name><gmapID>0x80dbfe36c3b7a2c7:0x8e10768a0238d2b9<//gmapID><Response>None<//Response>< Rate>

I requested a service call and Thomas Batterton was sent.  I was extremely impressed with his knowledge, honesty and efficiency.  Thomas quickly resolved the  minor issue with my heat exchanger (actually a loose screw).  I feel confident having the Precision Tune-up Program to ensure the proper operation for years to come.

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>I called Action Air in for a second opinion because the company who usually services my furnace seemed to be doing a guessing game as to why it wouldn't work.  Turns out their second guess isn't the problem either. Bill who has a lot of experience explained several things that needed to be changed so I am waiting for the pricing to decide to fix or replace.</review>< name>

I have been a customer of Action Air for about 15years now.
the service personnel are alwaysvery friendly, professional and do a great job!
I like that I can ask for a certain tech and usually get him for the service.  The reason for this is I have a protective dog and once he knows the person coming, he (dog)relaxes and accepts the fellow happily.
Over the years, there have been several different techs and all have been  excellent, polite, professional.   they really care and do a great job.

< Review>
I had a two for one issue with both my heating and air conditioning unit going out. Being in inland San Diego this was an issue as it gets cold during the night and blistering hot during the day. I didn't want just any yokel contractor working on it because I hate having people come back three times for the same issue.

I checked these guys reviews after doing a search and they seemed to be very legit. The day of the appointment I sat waiting for the inevitable 10 to 15 minutes late appointment. To my surprise they actually showed up a minute early.

After shaking hands I led them to air conditioning unit to let them work their blue collar magic bracing myself for a huge repair bill since the furnace and ac were out.

After all was said and done it did cost me (not that going with someone else would have made much difference) But I have to say they fixed everything promptly and I haven't needed to call their techs back for any reason.

That's a reason for a top rating in my book.</Review>

Action Air is very customer conscious and seems to always be thinking of my household running smoothly on their equipment every day.  Juan came to service my great Lennox HVAC today and he was courteous and very personable, explaining what he was doing and why.  I felt a great sense of trust that he would do the best job possible.  I love the HVAC that action air recommended to me; they know their products and they keep them serviced with great enthusiasm and care.  I am so glad I am their customer.  I have had many servicers over the years, but these people are wonderful!  Just phenomenal! Thank you Action Air!<//Text>

He was friendly and professional. He fully expalined his actions and findings during his diagnostics. He made no effort to upsell any service since the diagnostics showed proper operation of the unit.
Our discussion did suggest that a review of my programing of the thermostat might be useful. This ended up being the root cause of our troubles. With that reprograming we have had no further need to use the program reset on the furnace.
Well done Tom!</Text>< Pictures>
