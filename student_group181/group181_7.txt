Bought a nice ford crown victoria from here 3 years ago, since then Ive only put 10k miles on the car and the transmission started to slip. I drove it carefully and treated it like a baby. Turns out the transmission fluid was very dirty and the filter was clogged. Also, the transmission back seal was leaking....I had great customer service and they gave me a great price when i got it. I'm just a little hurt knowing that the transmission wasn't inspected at first.<//Text>

These guys were really good to me, but I came there knowing exactly what I wanted, and paid cash, so that helped.
The ABS computer was down, they offered to replace it for free.  Had I had to go to Ford and do that myself, I'm fairly certain it would have cost me a pretty penny.  So I'm grateful they took care of that outright from the beginning.  Yes I would recommend this dealer to others.
Their plot of land is small, so they can only fit so much inventory at a time, but vehicles turn over quickly, so check back often.  If they bought the vehicle from auction, just keep your expectations real, and realize that it more likely than not isn't going to be perfect... but with careful research and the Car Fox report... you can make an informed decision.< /text>

The sales team is fantastic and the vehicles are quality, most of which are formerly government owned. Just bought my 7th vehicle from them as of today. If you are in need of a great used vehicle then this is the place. Marshall Auto Sales will treat you right.< /Review>< Pics>

Marc was simply amazing. Easy to talk to, very professional, and valued his customers more than anything. I was able to finance a car easier than any dealership I’ve ever been too and it was all thanks to him. The people he works with are easy to deal with and fight to get the best deal for you and I was able to witness it first hand. I will be going back again and referring anyone else to them as well.</text>

<review>would give 0 if I could. Paid the 9k for the car and they wouldn't allow my father to use the restroom. We were told to use the restroom next door and were almost assaulted by someone. They argued and gave attitude when I asked questions.  i asked if my car had warranty and was told yes, when i went home my starter went out, when I called suddenly i didnt have warranty and passed the time limit to get it. Terrible conpany, would never buy from them again. 0 hospitality, i felt like a burden.</review><Rating>1< /Rating><Response>None<//Response>< user_name>

I was interested in one of their vehicles for sale. The sales men knew very little about it, but they assured me the vehicle did not have any issues. I drove several hours to their dealership and looked under the vehicle to see it was clearly leaking fluids and the dealership must have known about it since there were several pizza boxes under the vehicle to soak up the oil. Avoid this dishonest dealership.</Text>

<review>The best dealership in town. I bought 2 cars and i will say the best service ever provided. The staff is friendly and they take very good care of their customers. Cars are very good and i have been using them. Not even a single penny work required. 10/10 cars and they take extra care of their customers. Will definately continue buying cars. If you want good cars with good price you dont need to go anywhere else. Marshall auto sales have all you need. And they finance the minimum amount you can get.

Regards
A happy customer. :) :) :)<//review>< pictures>

I had a great experience working with Robert at Marshall auto sales. He lived up to every promise he made to me and I've recommended calling Robert at Marshall auto sales to all of my friends when they're ready to purchase their next car!</Text>

I just purchased my 2nd car from here, I shopped around both times and they had the lowest price.
Sincere no pressure purchase. I will definitely shop here again in the future.</Review>

Worst Place ever. They say one thing to get you. Once paper work is done EVERYTHING changes. Do Not Trust these people. And their 5 star reviews are from contracted people. There are some good used lots out there this one IS NOT ONE OF THEM!! STAY AWAY!!<//review>

Hi, I purchased a 2004 Cadillac Escalade with 114, miles and got a great deal. I have had no problems with vehicle and I as a woman with a very sick husband I told them I need dependability. Thats exactly what I got. They also helped me with insuring my vehicle and I couldn't ask for a more respectable and reputable car lot. With family owned for years. I have found my lot for life. Thanx Again Marshalls Auto sales.....A very happy Customer Tammy Dutye' From Stockton Ca....</Review>

<review>I wanted to plan a birthday escape and this experience went beyond what I was hoping for. My group was accommodated and even though a member of the party was delayed, they were able to hold the room for us. We had a fun time and all staff went above and beyond to make this day special.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x54d2ecb7fe7b948f:0x82ba9605c289a0c< /Gmap_id></record>

So much fun! The owners are also super fun, easy going, and helpful! (Had some scheduling issues and they helped right away.) Also the prison break room was perfect, hard but not too hard where you feel lost the whole time. Great time for friends and fam!</Text>

I've been here twice with my girlfriend and we didn't quite make it out the first time. But even though we didn't, both times were still great experiences. The rooms, the puzzles, and especially the staff. Great place, great peopl . I can't wait to do their other room and their new site<//Review>

<Text>This was so much fun!  We were celebrating a birthday and had no idea what we were doing, they let us bring in our alcohol, our guide was so cool, put up with our ridiculousness and played along and joked with us which made it so much more fun!
Would recommend everyone try this!</Text>< name>

I had no idea what to expect when I purchased our tickets. I was kinda skeptical because amusement in Redding is generally a let down. Escape Redding took fun to a whole new level!!! Not only was it a blast and very well organized but the staff was excellent an very personable. Thank you Escape Redding for the most fun I've had in a long time!!!</Review>

We played Escape Redding’s “Knight” room last night and had a good time. There were 6 of us. 2 newbies and 4 of us who have played Escape games at the other Redding Escape Room locations as well as in other cities. The room was done very well. The setting was awesome and all of the props were very cool. I can definitely appreciate the attention to detail that went into creating the experience. The staff member that helped us along our journey was very pleasant.

During our time in the room... 2 of the required props broke. Both were needed to uncover clues to move forward. The staff member had never encountered the issue and was unsure of what to do. It was a little disappointing for us and negatively impacted our experience and forced us to rush at the end to complete the objective.

I would rate my experience as a 3 Star. However, I am happy and supportive of this new local business and hope to see them thrive which is why I am giving it a 4 star rating. The issues that we encountered were unforeseen and couldn’t have been reasonably expected but certainly should have been handled differently.</text>

<text>Five of us played the Prison Break room and it was a blast! I loved the attention to detail and the ways they made the puzzles. The game host was so personable and enthusiastic about what he did. Loved that the vision of the business is to get people to connect in person instead of just through phones and social media.

The only thing that was weird for us is that the parking lot was not well lit so we had a little trouble finding it as well as it felt a little creepy. Be nice to see a better lit parking lot and maybe a neon sign to see that they're open.</text></record></dataset><record>

We have done two rooms with different groups, one mostly adults and their mostly 12 year olds (we were required to provide an adult with them). The puzzles are challenging but the staff provides clues if needed at optimal times. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the two experiences were quite different. They offer a discount on your second visit. We looked into their competitors but were turned off by staff so chose Escape Redding. I highly recommend Escape Redding!</text>

<text>Incredibly fun and addictive!!

I completed the Knight room along with 7 friends and we had a phenomenal time! The clues and puzzles were so entertaining and challenging. We we're able to solve it and came out of the room pumped up and ready to solve crimes

Two days later I went with 3 other friends and completed the Gentlemen's room. This room was spectacular with many surprises! I was amazed at the thought and work that went into building this room to make it exciting and heart racing.

I am so impressed with the escape rooms here that I'm returning very soon to complete the Prison Break room.

Also its important to note that the location is super convenient on hilltop and there is a great wine tasting room next door called Moseley's.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Oh, Escape Redding is absolutely FANTASTIC and a total must for anyone who loves escape rooms, and/or riddle games!

While I live in the Bay Area now, I grew up in Redding, and never would have imagined that escape rooms would make it this far up North, nor would I have imagined they would be as well thought out as Escape Redding.

A group of nine of us tried our luck with the "Knight Room" and had an incredible time! IT IS SO COOL. The attention to detail in this room is mind boggling - every clue and every riddle is intricately placed. It was challenging enough but not to the point that you were completely frustrated.

Another major plus is how kind the owners are. You can tell they put their heart into this business and thus charge a totally reasonable $25/person. We'll definitely be coming back to try the other rooms next time we're home!<//Review>

<Time>1524368055164</Time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>I will be as honest as possible. I mainly want this review to be seen as a suggestion versus a bad review. We actually had a good time and the staff was friendly. This was the knight.

1. The room where everything is explained before entering the actual room needs to be changed. When I entered this brightly lit room, it took away the suspenseful atmosphere. A bright room just seems like a super happy vibe.
2. In this same room, they used a PowerPoint presentation to explain everything. It kinda felt like being in school, so that too kinda took away the suspenseful vibe. The past host's we've had at different locations were VERY in character and had the script memorized so it felt like we were in an actor's presence. They knew how to set the tone. He was a great guy and all but again, it didn't capture the suspense.
3. There was no background music to help set the tone. No feeling of suspense or the feeling of running out of time. I want my heart racing and i want to be stressing out, lol
4. Another host popped in and out a couple times to help out but it ruined the atmosphere more than anything. When you're at the theater getting lost in the plot, you don't want someone to keep popping in and out, am I right?
5. Some issues with the props. The door was solved by my step dad just by tinkering around with it and not using the clues. That shouldn't be possible. There was a unlocked pad lock that wasn't fastened shut. Host's should double check things like that. There was a missing magnet to complete a task.
6. The tv monitor in the escape room should make like a small beep noise to notify about new information updated on the screen. We get lost in the moment and we don't even think about looking up at the screen.
7. We felt like too many hints had to be given out. The game should make connections quite smoothly. We shouldn't have to depend on the screen. We want to feel that self accomplishment.

We did have fun and I'm open to try another room. I'm not the type to ask for a refund but it would be nice to have a freebie invitation to make up for all the inconveniences that happened that day. Thanks again and I hope this review was helpful.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>Small playground for kids 3-7 I'd say. Had profanity written on the slide. I'm going to report to the city. Also one slide had a crack that could injure someone. The residents should be reporting these things. The grass area is large. Sports teams practice there. People walk dogs and themselves. Overall nice, just needs the damage fixed.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Great for walking laps while the kids play, but a little too close to a busy road. Cars tend to drive really fast which makes me really worry about the kids. Other than that this is a clean park with plenty of open space and nice grass< /Review>< Response>

This park is where my coaching experience started. I was hoping to bring back my kids soon but the ex keeps blocking me.</Text>

Great big park close to the house. I think the only thing that could make it better would be to have a shade over the playground. The equipment gets to hot in the summer sun.< /Text>

Three stars during pandemic, but definitely 5 stars in normal time.
2 places were open, the rest was closed (or wouldn’t take my order) even before 8:30pm. The guard kicked me out because I was eating a popsicle.< /Text>

Came for a late night beer and am really glad I did. I tried one of the more rare beers made locally. It was a little more alcoholic than most beers (aged in casks) but was as advertised. They promised hazelnut notes in my beer and they delivered. I am delighted to have had a beer here!!</review>

Delicious waffles hot off the press! I had a breakfast themed waffle sandwich (the superior meal) and my husband had the spicy chicken and waffle sandwich. We both loved the sandwiches and were overall very happy with the meal.

The only underwhelming part of our meal was the side of fried pickles. They were so heavily coated in batter that the pickles were lost.</Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>I used to frequent this place but I haven't been for quite some time. The IPA Irish Nachos aka the Fowl Play has gotten considerably smaller and the price hasn't been properly adjusted. I understand inflation but it was about half the size I remember it.

Food was still good (used to be great) but the portion was very small for what it cost. Beer selection is great but the food was what truly kept me around. After this last visit I may not be back again.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
This is a somewhat small location but it packs a lot of flavor. It's located in a shopping area with a decent amount of dining options. It has the feel of a craft beer joint but the food options really surprised me. I found myself talking about the "Hot Mother Clucker" sandwich for a few days after my visit. It was a spicy battered chicken sandwich with spicy slaw and waffles for the bun. Way fun.</Review>

<Review>Iron press still has the beer selection from years of establishing itself as an industry insider hotspot, yet, as its other locations' doors close, leaving the packing house location alone in the company's efforts to remain afloat, they are plagued by high prices and small portion size. They can turn it around but I only hope their corner cutting is a temporary survival tactic and not a progressive business strategy.</Review><GmapID>0x80dcd6300af25233:0x82f5cbe1a8a9bdb7<//GmapID><username>Stan Sharp</username>< userid>

Yes, this is a beer and waffle place. The food is surprisingly good--my spouse loves the waffles and I get the breakfast. Everyone we take there loves the dishes. Try the chicken pesto sandwich. We love Emily! She is the best! The other servers are pretty freakin' awesome too! Everyone is friendly,  knowledgeable about the beers and very conscious about your happiness as the customer.<//Review>

Pros: good beers on tap, for a reasonable price. The tater tots are awesome. The wait staff is very nice. Cons: wanted to like the waffle sandwiches but it pales in comparison to bruxie. The waffles itself didn't have as much of a taste, and I prefer the crunchier waffles at bruxie.< /review>

Slow, need more people working there. They where out of all the breads, half the soda machines were out. This would not be bad if the sandwich was good, but it was horrible.</Text>

Couldn’t recommend more. As a student of the nearby boarding school, this sandwich shop is not only the closest, but it is the greatest in the area. Outstanding customer service, the employees are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. The sandwiches have amazing value, and are incredibly delicious.<//text>

This isn't some dinky sub your getting, this thing is hefty. Stacked with turkey, bacon, avocado and choice of fixins. Ingredient quality and flavor is excellent. I got the footlong ate half and having the rest now for dinner and it held up perfect, tastes fresh. De-li-li-licious would recommend.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Nicw little church.  I have 4 kids and my boys tend to be very excited and get distracted easily so at times its hard to stay in church so we were offered to go to the children's room.... This is a room for families with small children so they can still attend mass without feeling like their kids are distracting others.  That room has a big window with the view of the alter and has speakers that allow you to follow the mass readings and lecture. They have late mass hours.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x8094c48f5d05b2f3:0x2fdea2d2cb0fef18< /GmapID></record>

All my events (ie. Baptisms, comunions, etc.) Have always been at this church. I moved a bit far away and no longer live in town. Four years ago i got married at this church to the man of my dreams. My husband passed last year in the worse way possible. I am still trying to put myself together piece by piece. I recently went there to begin the process of getting my son baptized there, as well as, me just being there was a huge step for me as it brings many memories and i knew would trigger my ptsd. My family still lives in town and he is the only one left to be baptized and i so wanted him to be baptized at the same church i call home. My husbands death has left me with PTSD among other social anxiety problems. When i went there i could not find the office. I knocked on what ever door looked lively and the "father" answered. When i asked for his help he rudely told me..."theres a sign out there" and closed the screen door. I said "excuse im sorry, there are a lot of sign's and im not sure which sign you are talking about." He said "right there in front of the church." (I couldnt even see where he was pointimg to as he didnt even open the screen door.) I said "infornt of the door?" He again in a rude tone said "cant you see it?" I said "no that is why im asking for help." I asked if he was the father and he said "sure am." And i said ok well i think i will go to another church. He said.... "You dont come to church anyways." I was so choked. I said, "i dont live here im from......" He said "who cares you dont come to anyways." I turned and said "if you must know... I witnessed my husband death in the worse way. We were married at this church and its been really difficult for me to be here." He then responded in a condescending manner " oh well...sorry...i didnt know." I dont live there so no i do come to that church anymore but as mentioned i had always had a special place in my heart for that church and was looking forward to celebrating these godly events with my family who still live in town and keeping my whole family under the same church (whatever is left of my family that is) especially since i plan on moving back to town. Instead i left in tears and infuriated. I thought the church is suppose to welcome ANYONE with love? Not just those who regularly attent that particular church. I still tear up at the thought that my son will be the only one not baptized at this church. Thankfully all churches serve the same lord and saver and still can have him baptized under the catholic church which is very much important to me. My parents even got married at this church. Sad to think this new father who i know hasnt been there for five years (as he is not the one who married me and my late husband) turned me away in tears during a time that was very difficult for me and needed my faith more than anything at that very second. Very dissapointed with this new father to say the least. Only regret not video taping him as i was so shoked at his demeaner towards me.< /Text>

last night was the first time we visited this fine restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the efficient service, with the great  food and fine drinks and with the modest payment. We will surely return there soon.</text>

<Text>I celebrated my nomination this evening in this fine place. Well we had a great evening and the restaurant was clearly the reason for that fruitful evening. The team  contributed in a splendid style, the cooking was very good and my guests were very  happy. We shall definitely visit again for more events. thanks very much.< /Text><user>116303300481465977774<//user><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<rate>3< /rate><Text>Went on a cold saturday evening and had the joint almost to ourselves. Ordered a cheeseburger and fries with condiments my way-no pickles, onions or mustard, with a coors (bottle) to drink. Sat at a booth downed a couple sips of suds and my dinner was served by an attractive bar tender/waitress just as ordered. None of the items i asked to NOT be on it were there! They actually listened to my requests and delivered! Burger was one of the best bar sandwiches Ive had. Served w/ chips and complimentary popcorn! If I lived closer (80+miles, @2 hour drive) I would eat there frequently. But you can bet that every time I find myself near Mi-Wok I will stop for some refreshments! And next time maybe a date with ms. cocktail!<//Text><Name>Kenny Klotz< /Name><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmapID>

Restaurant is closed and only a small bar with minimal options. The lady at the counter was nice enough to point out that we will be better served elsewhere. If you are from out of town then this is not your place to stop for a meal or drink. Look elsewhere.<//Review>

I love garlic, and they garlic the oysters like crazy here. The lobster is delicious, and is cooked perfectly with butter. It’s so much fun to dig into. We also love getting the Uni Pasta. It’s a very rich meal every time. It’s in the middle of a promenade food court in a very Asian area. Though it’s got nice modern decor, you are sitting in an open area where little kids will be running around and Asian parents will stare. I’m cool with that so it’s a good experience every time.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXtiKHfvsHKVZ45vCoqjW5lGvZ8bwOSsEkJWdf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG8JIDkJB-wMYysEdbznTe5qxvN19LeVkLXVlm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Stopped by here after our shopping at Westfield ran late, and they were conveniently having reverse happy hour! (Saturday 9pm-close)

THE GOOD
Happy hour prices can’t be beat. $1 chef choice oysters, a long list of menu items for under $10 (sashimi, carpaccio, sushi rolls, fries, etc). Tbh I probably wouldn’t come here if not for happy hour just because the regular menu gets pricey and you won’t feel the freedom to try lots of things.

We liked the salmon and yellowtail carpaccios. Very fresh and flavorful, seasoned well.
Garlic wings were good, no complaints
You can also get sake for cheap happy hour prices

Food came out super fast. Like within 10min all 6 items were on the table.

THE DISAPPOINTING
The oysters were...inconsistent. Some were too briny (borderline unfresh?) others were ok. Hit or miss
Our fries came out lukewarm, and within a couple minutes were starchy and soggy. I hope it was just an off day.< /Review>

< Review>
We tried this for the first time and it was a good experience. Sea bass fillet was just awesome – cooked to perfection and tasty.  The lobster roll was also good but don’t keep it in the fridge and try it the next day – you won’t like it. The fries with mushroom Aioli was good too. Seafood stew was just average. Given the prices, it should have been better. High prices compared to other places. Service is average. Service should be better than this given the high prices.<//Review>

You must try:
Clam Congee - surprisingly flavorful
Brussels Sprouts - delicately crispy
Crab cake toast

Sorry there isn’t a picture of the Brussels sprouts. I ate them all.</review>

<text>the only problem we had was with the portion size on some of the plates we ordered being too small. the location is easy to find within the mall and it's really enjoyable as you're not really inside and you're not really on the outside. we were told that there is sometimes a line or reservations needed so i suggest you make sure to come out a little earlier to make sure you're seated</text>< pics>

They have changed their happy hour menu. It definitely has not been as happy anymore. They do still have $1 oysters. I'm not a fan anymore. Gonna have to find a different place to go.< /review>

<Review>Staff was friendly and welcoming. It's amazing you can find quality food in a mall. Parking sucked, paid $18+tip but not the fault of the restaurants. My friends ordered lobster and king crabs. I had the sashimi platter. We all were very satisfied with our orders. Looking forward to coming back to explore the menu. Clams and oysters 😎.</Review>< pictures>

Expensive when it's not happy hour, but when it is, it's time to get spending. Oyster selection is great. Uni pasta has fresh uni with a good strong sweet taste. Highly recommended.< /Review>

Food is getting worst that is why it is empty of customers.
We visited this place the third time. The previous two times were ok. This time. We ordered cooked oysters with butter and what we got were spoiled oysters, which can be smelled 10 fteet away. It was so terrible smelling ( dead oysters).
I ended up canceled the order and talked to the store mgr.
I was told by the server oysters were fresh caught yesterday. It was all lie.
To make a long story short.
I never come back to this place ever.<//text>

Had the Uni Pasta upon recommendation by Michael, the concierge at Westfield Mall, and it was out of this world!

For the price of $24, the dish was just full of creaminess, umami and pure flavour.  The portion size was big and there were two big pieces of Uni as well.   Definitely a must-try.

My husband and I were hoping to get some $1 oysters for happy hour but we missed it. Next time.<//text>

If you have never been to any of the EMC Seafood Locations I definitely would recommend coming to this one over the LA Ktown location! The location in Ktown always seems to be busy with a wait and parking is definitely a pain there.

This location at the Westfield Santa Anita Mall had no wait time and of course tons of easy parking because it's at a giant mall. Definitely on the smaller side compared to the Ktown location but the restaurant had a pretty chill open air vibe. Felt like I was eating at an open air street market.

We didn't try too many things but here is a breakdown of what we got:

Pros:
-Crispy Pepper Calamari with Spicy Aioli:
This was by far my FAVORITE dish we ordered. Perfect light crispy batter and I really enjoyed the peppers/garlic/and green onion garnish.

-Special: Grilled Tuna Collar:
Great portion for the price. Nice and charred  with a great dipping sauce to accompany it (kind of like a chimichurri).

-Shu Mai:
Not sure if this was a daily thing or just on the weekends (we went on a Sunday). Average size and pretty good flavor. Obviously not going to be as cheap as actual dimsum restaurants.

Cons:
-Har Gow:
Unfortunately I would steer clear of the Har Gow next time. The wrapper on all four of the shrimp dumplings was basically mushy and disintegrated when we went to pick them up.

Overall EMC is a solid dining option when shopping at the Westfield Santa Anita Mall! On the list to try next visit are the fresh oysters and the Uni Pasta!<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>The quality of food here, is absolutely top notch. I’ve been here a couple of times, and each time better than the next.
The food:
Seafood and sushi is fresh and high quality
Wagyu beef is a must, and carefully cooked
Truffle fries - a delicious treat with a delicate and memorable truffle mushroom aioli
Umi Pasta - acquired taste for those who truly enjoy the seafood flavor - incredibly delicate and a popular item

Atmosphere: it is located on the eating strip connecting the promenade and the mall. A beautiful lit atmosphere with a hip ambience. Only downside is, it gets cold as it Leeds to the outdoor promenade.

Overall, it’s pricey but their happy hour menu is a great deal. Worth the splurge if you’re looking for seafood.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2dbbd0b1de3f9:0x468ce8059795f231</gmap_id></record>

We ordered the foe gras roll, scallop carpaccio, and uni pasta...they were so delicious!  It could get a bit pricey as their portions are not very big, so you may actually need to order appetizers or side dishes if you are a big eater. The waitress kept pushing us to get oysters but we did not want any at the time.</review>

<review>A bit disappointed. We could only order oysters by the dozen or half dozen. The green chili mignonette overpowered the flavor of the oyster. The other condiment was ketchup with horseradish, not traditional cocktail sauce. The oysters were good, but poorly shucked (lots of bits of shell in the oysters).<//review>< Pics>

Not quite as nice as the original Koreatown locatio, but a welcome location in Westfield Santa Anita. The garlic noodles and uni pasta are just as good as in Koreatown, but the ambience, sushi and lobster roll is definitely a downgrade. Still can't ding them too much since the noodles are top notch.<//review>

Great location right between Din Tai Fung and the outdoor promenade, very clean And simple location. The food is fresh and delicious maybe a little pricey but you get what you pay for</Review>

Wow! Awesome oyster on the half shell plus the mixed seafood platter was definitely worth the $39. Will be eating here again.</review>

<review>Restaurant is situated in odd elongated shape with no walls facing crowds walking by, i guess some people like that type of ambience.  We went there mainly for the raw oysters. Depending on the season, they carry different types ranging from regions of origin and size of oysters.  Price is not cheap but at least the oysters are fresh and passed my gastro adventure; at least no diarrhea or vomiting.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2dbbd0b1de3f9:0x468ce8059795f231< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>Awesome deli for wonderful subs and sandwiches. I also had a bowl of chili that was good but a bit watery so one star off for that and I've had better elsewhere.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
I love Firehouse and I think they are way better then Subway. I just wish that they would Toast the buns too. Maybe they do actually? I'll have to ask next time. Last time I went I think the owner was there or the manager because he said hi to me and bye to me when I went. I thought that was cool too because a lot of places don't even care anymore. The staff here are always really nice and speedy too. I've never had a bad sandwich ever from this chain and I am definitely coming back again. See you again soon!<//Review>

I did not have a good experience.  My food was cold , and the cashier was very abrupt and rude .. I think her name was Bianca? Petit , skinny, brunette , caucasian.  I asked her if she could fix my order and she was not willing to accommodate .  I was perplexed by her attitude. .

I even consulted with the store manager , and I found him to be cold too.  Brunette hair, glasses, a little chubby. I thought he would try to help me and my family out, but he was very indifferent.

Nevertheless , I will not be returning to this Firehouse Subs location nor recommend it.

Seems like they need to revisit their customer service training 101.< /Text>

Firehouse subs are always tasty!!! I use to go to the Point Loma location, until it closed. I still manage to drive out there before remembering it's a new shop now. lol I tried to go to the location in Chula Vista, but their prices are higher!?! These subs aren't cheap, but they're reasonable.

My only complaint is there was a woman working...she was kind enough!...but she contested/argued things when something went wrong. Instead of just fixing things, it just sounded like blame passing. Example: I heard a man before me tell her that his order was suppose to be to-go. No big deal, right? All that needed to be said was a quick, "oops, sorry! Let me bag it right up", but instead she said she had heard "for here" and mumbled something else about what the man might have said when he placed his order. Whether she might have been correct or not doesn't matter. The end result was the guest did get his order to-go, but left kinda miffed. As for me: I ordered a Hook&Ladder sandwich with a few modifications (no onion/mustard, add pickles). All of that was correct on the sandwich I got, except they forgot the ham! lol No big deal. I just went back and told them. Except that same woman then tried to say I must have gotten the wrong sandwich. ?? Someone else ordered the same mods and same bun (wheat), same size, but specifically only ordered turkey? Now, what are the odds? Haha A mistake is no big deal. Especially because the lovely young girl at the counter was so sweet and apologetic, and the gentleman who originally handed me the sandwich was super friendly, and the sub was still delicious ham or not! There's no reason to make weird excuses! But that won't stop me from coming back for more delicous subs, especially while they're having a $5 sub promo!<//review>

<review>Wholesome and healthy but smaller portion than I had anticipated for the price.
Of course, I'm not a very small man, so it's subjective at best.
Overall good experience, excellent staff and very accommodating.
Much appreciated.</review>< user_id>

We went because we had a coupon. I had chicken bacon ranch and it was okay. My son was very disappointed with the New York Steamer. There was hardly any meat. It was all bun. Won't ever get that again. Most likely won't go back... Not worth the trip or money.<//review>

Terrible service. First they screwed my order up and luckily I'm not allergic to anything they put in the sandwich. Then we called and they said its because they have new people and they guess they just didn't care. And on top of that, the sandwich was ice cold when it shouldve been hot. 10/10 WOULD NOT recommend!</Review>

Excellent food and friendly service. Recommended combo is the Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket with the chain's unique Cherry Lime-Aid. Also offers rewards points for users of the app. Prices scale a good bit with bigger sizes, but you get a lot on your sandwiches.< /Review>

I love Firehouse Subs, and I've been eating them since I was on the east coast.  To me, the serve the perfect sandwich.  The bread is toasted to a nice crisp, the meats are flavorful and juicy, and the flavors are well-balanced, not too salty or sweet.

Among my favorite sandwiches include the Hook and Ladder--the honey ham is simply delicious and adds a savory sweetness to the sandwich that makes it very well balanced, the New York Steamer--probably the best corned beef and pastrami I've had outside of NYC, the Meatball sub, and the brisket sandwich, which has a nice smoky flavor to the brisket slices.  (My friend and I used to often joke it's smokier than most other BBQ joints in San Diego!)  In addition to the sandwiches, the cookies are great.

For any regional or national franchise, Firehouse Subs is definitely my go-to for sandwiches.</review>

The majority of the time I get the brisket.  I have always enjoyed this sandwich at Firehouse Subs.  This location had the worst brisket sandwich I've ever had.  Dry, bread tasted stale.  I would have said something hadni not taken the sandwich to go.  The only reason for 2 stars is the friendliness of the staff.<//text>

I have no idea how they have this rating. I literally get tomatos, pickles, lettuces and cheese and Everytime (4times) I have come in they have found a way to mess it up. They are always very rude especially the "manager" or " owner" her badge changes Everytime too. When I told them they made it incorrect she snapped it from my had and started slamming things behind the counter. I keep trying again and again with same results. Check your orders!< /review>

Order placed at 11:38 didn't have a sandwich in my hand until after noon. Almost had to walk out to make it back to work in time. Staff was trying their best, but they were swamped with online or phone orders. Food was good, but I had to eat it for dinner because I had to race back to work.</text>

<text>Ordered thru Doordash and it arrived ahead of time but the sandwich my husband(a retired firefighter) ordered was put together poorly. The bread was smashed down even tho it was in a box. It was supposed to come with chips, a pickle and a cookie but all it came with was a cookie. Total order was $13.57 with tax and delivery  I will NOT be ordering from them again. It was just sloppy.<//text>< Rating>

The owner / manager, Sharon...is rude, loud, doesn't know what she's doing. It seems like there are always issues at this location and a customer is unhappy whenever I come here. You think it would be a good place to go for quick lunch on work break but it's not.</text>

The food was standard firehouse, but they didn't have any diet sodas, no brownies or cookies, and the service was really slow. The staff was nice, though, and they made my son a brownie.<//review>

It's a very bad service.I went there because I had a question of pickup service, but I waited for 1hour 30 minutes. each person about 25minutes.Then service lady gave me supervisor Christina phone number and make call 8:30am. At 8:30 am the next day, I kept calling supervisor christina  five times, but she didn't answer.As national officials, they should know that they are working on our taxes.The service level is zero.</review>

Awful run around after two staff assured me they would hold my mail. Not there when I came when I said and they knew I would be coming. And when they transfered me to a supervisor (they said I should speak to one, I hadn't asked for one) she put me on hold and then hung up on me. I called repeatedly until someone had to pick up and for the 5th time had to explain the situation and they were hasty with me. I just want to know what they did with my hold since I had bills and paychecks in there. A friend said she got a card sent back to her and I think that is the only way I have an answer. Why can't they just say where it went? Why give me a run around? Why hang up on me? If you sent it all back to senders, then say you did.

I come here about once a week and object to the characterization of "rude  employees" and "bad service" in other reviews. I have never been treated poorly here and there is one desk clerk who has always been particularly kind and accommodating. I'm knocking off a star for the appearance of the exterior which is sometimes untended, with overgrown dry weeds, and for their occasional inattention to homeless people lounging on the front step (there are lots of other places for the homeless to congregate), but overall it's a fine P.O. branch.< /text>

<review>This office is in a great location and has a spacious parking lot. Very easy to access. Staff here though is rude and so entitled. The worst I've ever encountered. It's very unfortunate, but also perfect example of why Fedex and UPS will eventually push USPS our of business.< /review>< pics>

The mailmen tend to make your package as "undeliverable" in order to give themselves an extra day to deliver your package. Today, the tracking number said they had "no access to deliver location". I don't even have a gate to my house. They can walk up to my front door. That should be criminal.</text>

Couldn't deliver a registered letter. And, said they didn't have it when recipient went to pick it up from station. Website wouldn't allow me to reschedule delivery even though that was one of the options that it lists.<//Text>

<Review>Sal from that location is the best. He always delivers my package to my home and he doesn't leave the note outside. Our place has a long stair to walk up, image if the postman has so many packages, it is hard for him to walk up. A very friendly guy and responsible postman. USPS should be very happy to have him! The staffs there generally are very friendly. When I had problems before, the 2 managers were pretty helpful. We really appreciate the service there, I think that is the best location / service that we have received from USPS so far.
Comparing to UPS, our guy always leaves note outside, one time he called me and I told him we were at our home. He excused the intercom is so hard to see, so he left.....with the note outside.</Review>< UserId.>

The note said, "Can you please take this back to sender. I forgot to process their postage! Sincerest apologies!" Instead of correcting their mistake and paying out their own pocket, they send it back to me.

I go and try to sort out this situation on Wednesday, only to be forced to pay twice for priority shipping.

I won't be coming to this location ever again.<//review>< pictures>

This office forced us to place our mailboxes in our complex on the front fence at great expense because the carrier was too lazy to walk the few steps in and place at our doors.  The front fence is not secure and neither are any of the post office approved mailboxes that are locking.  Many criminals appear to have these keys (I have suspicions that this is done with help from postal employees).  We've been plagued with mail theft for the past 3 years as a result.  This office is absolutely unconcerned with security of mail.  They have other priorities (clearly not related to something that should be an obvious priority).  I've spent hours trying to find a workaround rather than dealing with this office.  The quest continues.<//text>

Of all the places I've lived in the US and all the postal locations which have delivered my mail, this has to be the most consistently poor quality location I've had to use. They regularly deliver mail to the wrong locations, falsely claim to have delivered mail that they didn't really deliver, and destroy mail and packages as they shove them into my box with no regard to the contents. They have made claims of delivery without leaving a note behind. They have claimed to have knocked on my door (on multiple occasions) when I was home and within a few feet of my front door.

They finally pushed me to write this review when they claimed to have delivered a package that was never actually delivered. Trying to contact them about the package had them hang up on me multiple times, leave me on hold indefinitely, and even refused to pick up their phone for a full day. An entire day when the post office simply didn't answer the phone to either line (after they had already hung up on me a few times and put me on hold with no response). When I finally got someone on the line to speak to me, they "looked into it" which meant that their claim of a delivery was going to stand, and there was nothing I could do about it.

Unfortunately, I'm stuck with their terrible service until I move, and they know this. Nothing like having zero accountability at your job.

Edit: Less than two weeks after this incident, they again failed to deliver a package to my box and claimed it was delivered. They again won't answer their calls. Considering how often they deliver other people's mail to my box (easily 2-4 times per week), I can only assume they are just dropping my mail in other people's boxes where it is lost indefinitely.</text>

< Review>
The absolute worst Post Office in existence. If only I could give 0 stars. They are constantly late with deliveries and lie on their tracking info. There have been numerous times where my package was marked as "Delivered" or "Attempt made but receptacle was blocked" but no package  has been delivered. It is IMPOSSIBLE for my mail receptacle, on my front porch, to be BLOCKED WHILE I AM HOME. I know as a 100% fact that no attempt was made as I was waiting for the package all day. This place is terrible. They don't even pick up the phone to help you understand where your package is. I have caught them a few times saying an attempt was made or it was delivered when it wasn't and they would have someone PERSONALLY DRIVE OVER just to correct their mistake since I caught them red handed. Tear this post office down please, it's just not good in any way, shape, or form.</Review>

<Review>WORST SERVICE EVER I have never been treated so badly just to renew a passport. Me and my mother went on just obtain one piece of paper. Her accent was heavy and I kept asking what she is saying and she would get mad. She kept laughing at my mother with broken English. We asked another clerk who spoke Spanish and was nicer but not even she understand ed what the other clerk was saying. The other clerk kept getting mad at us for not understanding her. Her name was ms.wu if I recall.<//Review>< username>

Just rude, uncaring, I will never use USPS again, and I recommend no one else does too.<//text>

I have to agree with a lot of these people.  The service is really bad.  They don't answer the phones, and to get help in the passport department is a joke.  I have tried several times and it's always someone different and they don 't know what is going on there..they are clueless.<//Text>

The female carrier & supervisors at ER Post Office forget what it is they were hired for -- TO DO THEIR JOBS!!

If they were doing their jobs, why do I constantly receive damaged mail, parcels.  Now, because I refuse to keep quiet about their HORRIBLE SERVICE, and started to complain, I am being punished and they are now REFUSING to deliver my parcels, packages, and/or mail.

We need the Postal Police and Washington DC to step in and STRAIGHTEN THEM OUT AND/OR REPLACE THEM WITH NEW EMPLOYEES!!

Tired of no one wanting to do their jobs, and the odd thing of it is, they forget -- WE ARE PAYING TO GET OUR PACKAGES, MAIL, ETC., delivered to our residence.

It makes me sick to have to deal with a bunch of morons!

Called on phone waited for over an hour on hold,  called multiple times and still put me on hold to speak to mail supervisor about mail hold, told them we moved and mail still goes to previous address and we go check to see the mail and no mail is there.

Large product selection of both organic as well as normal foods, produce and milk and yoghurts. One of my favorite parts of this store is the selection of cheese. Combined with the broad selection of wines, you can surely find the ingredients for a great night in front of one of your favorite movies.< /Text>

I kinda dig shopping at Trader Joe’s with them restricting people, usually it’s a madhouse in there. I felt decently safe, was able to find everything I needed, and checked out in great time. Cashiers are always friendly and nice and I’m thankful they are working during this time.<//text>< rate>

The products of Trader Joe's I sincerely love. I do not buy meat from here so I am giving my opinion based on the stuff I buy like milk , juices, snacks,fruit and vegetables. I have been buying stuff from Trader Joe's in general for past 12 years.  Where ever you go, the store is the same. The only issue I have here now a days is the store is small and due to Covid 19 guidelines, only few people are allowed at one time so we have to stand in line but the employees are doing great job in managing. Please try to pick times when the store is not crowded. The prices are reasonable and affordable.</Text>

As always fantastic . One of my favorite at trader Joe's is organic turkey slice and pepper jack cheese. When I don't have time to cook I grab few slices of turkey and a slice of cheese and one tomato with lettuce and bread to go that's lunch at work.</review>

Everything was awesome except I would really love if establishments stopped allowing people to wear gloves in the store. Its transfers germs and it gives a false sense of security< /Text>

<review>I am disgusted with Trader Joes...please don't misunderstand me...I am the MOST conscious COVID person on the planet but having to wait in line to get into these stores is absurd...I was just at the Pleasanton store, had to once again wait in a line of 20 people only to discover, not for the first time, that the store was nearly vacant...yikes...I'm certainly not condemming safety precautions, but this is ridiculous!!!  And some stores only let you walk in certain directions once in the store...please, enough is enough!!!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
TJ's used to be my number one choice, but since the pandemic began, it has become my last choice, and I am pretty much weaned off due to attitude of employees. I'm referring to the Pleasanton store and I've experienced this from one other store. It's never OK for an employee to be disrespectful or rude to a customer, no matter what. Yes, it's stressful on both ends but WE are the customer, WE pay your salary so please, employees, keep YOUR attitude in check and learn to be more patient with impatient customers. There is a LOT of competition out there! Try to remember that.<//Review>

Waiting in line outside is annoying. This is the only company who makes patrons do this. But aside from that, this was probably the best Trader Joe's I have been to mainly because it is naturally larger and it feels like everything is more spread out.< /Text>

<Review>Having been told that 8-9 am is the senior hour so I felt safe going to Pleasanton TJ's. I did not experience that. There were all ages. Very disappointing.  You cannot advertise one thing and not follow thru. If that hour has been set aside for over 65 then keep it that way.< /Review>< Pics>

Place for favorite sliced French Brioche. This bread is so good. Good selection of cheese. Other Trader Joe's items I find it expensive though.</Text>

<text>My least favorite TJ in the 30+ I've frequented.  Parking is very limited and dangerous to get in and out.  Their food variety is very limited vs other TJs yet they have an ample selection of alcoholic drinks.  Staff is generally friendly and helpful.  Avoid the weekend rush if you can...<//text>< pics>

Still not allowed to carry your own bags. But I carry one in my car and take the shopping cart to the parking lot to fill the bags thereby avoiding buying paper bags @ 10 cents during every purchase.</Text>

<Review>Busy Trader Joe’s location. Much better than the old location - bigger, better chance to find parking.

All the great things you find at a TJs - fresh produce, including organic, gourmet cheese and sliced cured meats, nuts and dried fruits, wine, beer and liquor, fresh cut flowers, orchids, seasonal potted plants, fresh and frozen meat, poultry, and seafood, and lots of snacks.

Friendly staff. They are generous with the stickers for the kids. Kid sized shopping carts are great to help kids become life long TJ shoppers.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Resp>

Can’t wait for San Ramon location. I have been shopping here for last 12 years and I am so impressed with their customer service and offerings. One suggestion if I can will be to please reduce packing waste. Even though I recycle all that packaging it is too much.<//Text>

Love the store! Great options & great staff. Only downfall is the way people drive in the parking lot, crazy and usually on their cell phones. Choose your time to shop carefully.<//Review>

<Text>I don't know anyone yet who went to a Trader Joe's and haven't have a great experience. If I didn't love doing what I do, I will love working there. Everybody its friendly, smooth and soft in the way they talk.

Obsessed! Such fantastic finds and regular stuff you use! Love it. Employees are super nice too. I was upset after getting some bad news while I was shopping and one of the employees saw me. Next thing I knew she had given me a bouquet of flowers!! Made my day! Thank you! Since they moved the parking is awesome now too. Great prices as well!! A lot of vegan choices if that's your thing. And great premade quick g4ab stuff too👍👍👍<//Review>

<Text>I love Trader Joe's. I used to be a Safeway fan, but now I'm a Trader Joe's fan. Pro's: cheaper produce, awesome yogurt, yummy frozen section, free coffee, and high quality bath and cleaning products. Con's: Super expensive meat, drinks, and sometimes parking is difficult. I think my favorite part of all is that there are always lots of cashiers so the line is minimal to none at all!<//Text><gmap_id>0x808fe93abdbc697b:0x6c99c1fdc12ad065</gmap_id>< rating>

I go to this one specifically for my lunch's a lot and sometimes will specifically go here for my at home needs even though I live in San Jose. I love this store because the staff here is super friendly, as in they want to be your friend not just a helper at the store. I always feel at home when I come to this Trader Joe's.

Only complaint is how small the parking lot is.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>Friendly employee went out of her way to get me some fruit from the back when the bin was low. Nice selection of fresh fruits & veggies, deli meats, pre-packaged salads. TJ's own line is economical & of great quality. Nice selection of snacks, frozen desserts, & beer and wine. Trader Joe's "Two Buck Chuck" wine is a best seller - very good for the price. Decadent selection of chocolates, too. Love this place. HATE the small, crazy, parking lot. That's the big downside to shopping here & my rationale for four stars instead of five.<//review>< Pictures>

Almost everyone who works here is super friendly. They help everyone very quickly and the store is well maintained. It's small for a Trader Joe's and the parking is a nightmare, but they can't really do anything about that...<//Text>

I love Trader Joe's! This location is always jam packed parking wise, and is not the easiest navigate around while parking. The selection is alright sized, and I would consider this a smaller Trader Joe's than some other locations.< /review>

<Review>I don't know what we would do without Trader Joe's. We do about 80% of our grocery shopping there. Pleasanton location is a nice new store, bright, spacious, and has nice staff. You'll find all of your favorites here just as at other TJ's locations.<//Review>< pics>

I don't know what we would do without Trader Joe's. We do about 80% of our grocery shopping there. Pleasanton location is a nice new store, bright, spacious, and has nice staff. You'll find all of your favorites here just as at other TJ's locations.<//Text>

<text>I'm a regular visitor to this location. Last month I bought some cookies that my kids love, the Expiration date shows as Nov 2018, I opened the packet and ate to find they were stale and smelling horrible. I went back taking them to tell the customer support that the cookies are smelling horrible and in fact the customer rep tried it too. I went back after four weeks and those batch of cookies still siting there and told the customer service that they need to take them off the shelf before someone gets sick. It looks like they don't care customers complaining. The Customer rep mentioned they cannot do about it, which is kind of a weird answer that the corporate has to decide.......until then they will sell them to the customers.....yes I agree, and the guy to whom I complained was not too happy to check my things out and was like.....</text>< Pictures>

I've been going to this TJs for over 25 yrs. It's my go-to place for pretty much everything. And since it's TJs, it's bound to be good for you, one way or another. The only times I've been disappointed was when they would discontinue an item. But I got over it.< /Text>

Trader Joe’s cash cow is the cow. Literally. With the Trader Joe’s full fat milk thinner than Horizon’s 1%, you must be wondering where Trader Joe’s makes profits. Well, now you know.</review>

<Text>I live a lot closer to this location than I do to Livermore and I actually go out of my way to go to Livermore. I avoid this location any time I can. The staff has been very rude almost every time I go in there (if not, they just don't say a word to me at all.... awkward!), I have to fight for parking, the customers are super rude also, the produce is always super picked through or half rotten. Just a horrible experience all around. I love TJ's which is why it makes me sad that I have to go out of my way to go to another location. Oh well.</Text><time>1501125565294< /time>< response>

<Text>Great inside. Outside sux. No Safe Parking. First time i utilized that verbage on descriptives. Prices slowly went up-not fooled. They are getting better about listening to their customer base. Used to be non-contactable at Home Base level and only talked to each other before. Now they communicate better. Parking has ALWAYS a nightmare. I have been struck twice over time. NOW, they are finally moving into an old Fresh-N-Cheezy. LOTs of parking even EV connectors right outside. Bigger delivery out back and side now for workers. Plenty just south of CVS. Unique items-decent prices. Downfall-cookies are all 3.99 or higher (except for tiger & cat cookies for children).
Limited menu. New item area TJ's brand less than WFM's 365 store brand. Free coffee and sampling throughout the day different items.<//Text>< Resp>

Trader Joe's anytime and anywhere are the same, cordial staff, 4000+ items and ofcourse organic products is a great way to shop in TJ. Just go for it. One less star as I felt unlike other TJs I have been to in LA, this place is rather too quiet and too laid out. Wish we have a TJ in Pleasanton closer to downtown.< /text>

Parking lot is crowded always. This store is moving to Rose Pavilion where Sprouts Market used to be . Hope this will ease the parking situation.<//text>

This is not one of my favorite Trader Joe's. The parking here is absolutely horrible. The Shoppers are rude and there's always a line. I'd rather drive a few extra miles into the Livermore Trader Joe's then to have to deal with the people and the parking at this store<//Text>

<text>one reviewer complained about parking and lack of  staff rectifying it, how  its  not under their  control unless they re-locate the store, Cmon use your brain .Another claimed ALL of them have bad parking, not true. Some yes, but really. Parking in the Bay Area is a nightmare, is the  price you pay for living here. Stop whining~<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

It seems that every Trader Joe's goes out of their way to find locations with the worst parking possible. I've shopped at 4 stores; three when I lived on the peninsula, and now this one. I thought because the peninsula is more crowded, they didn't have a choice, and now I know they pick their stores on purpose...probably cheap rent. The parking stinks, and I only go there for a couple of specific items, and as infrequently as possible.<//Text>
