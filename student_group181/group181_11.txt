<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>I would give zero star if I can. The first time I appointed at 2pm but got 10 minutes late. Then they reject service since they said we are late. We appointed another day at 3:00pm and arrived early for 10 min and drop the key and went shopping at Costco. We came back 4:00 later and they said they haven’t start yet. 4:50 they finally start working on my car. What is the point of rejecting service for being late 10 min? This is the worst experience at Costco.< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< Time>

The tire price was higher than local offers - but took it since it comes with warranty. But now...
30 minutes, no one takes phone.
ONLINE RESERVATION WORKS WELL.  But why not phone? What will people with no internet knowledge do?<//text>

No kidding!! They broke it but implied that it was not their fault...! We had to request an incident report to be filled and then we had to chase people around in order to get our copy. No solutions were offered. No apologies were given. It’s a total shame !!!!! We were left there with our half-broken car and had to manage to get home by ourselves.

Guy looked at my flat and declared it has to be a new tire. On opening it seemed like a smaller problem that can be patched. Not happy about the lack of diligence.

One upside to Costco is the warranty on the tyres. If something goes wrong they refund you.< /review>

Had a flat tire and needed a new tire. Tried to set an appointment on their website but their website did not work. So I tried to phone them but they never answered the phone.  So I went in and stood in a long line. No problem. I paid for the tire and a few days they called me to bring my car in. Again, I tried to call to make an appointment but they never answered the phone.  This time I used a desktop to go to their website and the earliest appointment was September 3, six days from now.  So I just walked in and again waited in a long line. The guy said it would be 3 1/2 hours because I didn’t have an appointment and they’d call me when it was ready. Fine. I waited 4 hours and still no call. So then they said it would be another 1.5 hours before they could get to it. I said “I’ve already waited 5 hours and you said it would be 3 1/2”. The guy responds with a dismissive “we’ve been busy.” Well, so am I.

So then he says appointments get priority. When I asked “how do you make an appointment when you don’t answer your phone?” he says “you’ve got to keep trying.”

You’ve got to be kidding. Never never never never again.  What an insanely frustrating place. You try to do it online but their website drop downs don’t work. Then when you call, they literally never answer the phone.  While you are waiting for them to answer the phone they make you listen to the most annoying loop of instructions. Don’t bother waiting for them to answer, they never will!

I used Costco because I expected it was convenient and a bit cheaper. It was never convenient and if it was cheaper, it was certainly not worth the time I wasted. Horrible experience. Don’t make the same mistake I did. Go somewhere else with a better customer rating.<//Review>

Arrived at the tire center at 4:31, waited in line for 15 minutes (dropped keys off at 4:45). I was told it was going to be 60-90 minutes. Came back at 5:30, car hadn't moved. Was told they would take my car in right away. It's now 6 and they're just getting around to processing my car (haven't moved it to the bay yet). They're estimating another 60+ minutes to actually do the work that should have been done at the appointment time.

Overall, an unpleasant experience and a waste of time.</review>< Pictures>

Parking was a problem, I was quoted one price, I went back the same day and another person charged me around $30 less not sure why. But with in an hour and a half I had 4 new tires. But I had to take my vehicle to another place for an alignment. It's difficult to get to the tire place because of the long lines of car's gasing up.< /review>

Came in here because I had a flat tire and also I thought all of my 4 tires needed to be replaced. The guy examined my tires and said I only need to replace the flat one, the rest 3 look good. But Costco doesn’t carry my tire brand, he advised that it’s better to have the same brand of tires on all 4 wheels, so he recommended a couple of tire shops, and even told me to make sure they order the right version, nothing lower, or else it’s a down grade. He was able to help me switch on the spare. I was really happy with the honest feedback and service.</Text>

The technicians are knowledgeable but the service is not great. There are only 2 persons taking care at the front office and taking around 15-20 mins per customer. Increasing to one more person should make it better. The actual repair or job might be done perfectly but people waiting so long is not acceptable.<//Text>

<Review>WORST TIRE CENTER - DONOT visit this Place!

I had a nail in my front tire and got it checked.(After waiting for 45 mins in line) The guy asked me to Buy 2 tires(And btw the one who checked never found the nail and insisted me to Buy tires as he cant Patch the current one - Treads were in CA standards checked it) so we placed the order, but got an tentative appointment for until after the tires will be shipped to store. Firstly the guy asked to me order the tires Online directly saying it gives a cheaper price online.(Trying to avoid work) I still ordered the tires in Store and checked online quickly it was exact same price to the cent as I live in same Zip code. Next morning, the tire pressure was down by 8 points I took the car to GoodYear tires and guess what they patched the same tire for free and said the tires need no replacement and are good for next 2 years. I called costco to cancel the order, they couldn't do it as the order was placed in store, so called the store and they asked me to come in person. I stood in line for another 40-50 mins and they tell me the tires are still NOT shipped and the order can only be canceled once the tires are here. When I asked for manager the desk operator was rude and told me that "HE CANT CALL THE PILOT OF THE PLANE carrying the TIRES for Cancelation." I was surprised with his answer as what does an online order placed in store to do with Tires been shipped by plane/train whatever. I waited and kept requesting for the manager. FINALLY, they decided to give me a REFUND which took 7 Business days to revert and I had to stand in refunds line another 20 mins.

PLEASE DONOT VISIT this STORE. You can try other tire Stores but DEFINATELY DONT GO TO COSTCO TIRES. (As a Premium Member I did not expect this kind of service)< /Review><Response>None< /Response><Name>swapnil shevate< /Name>< Gmap_id>

They recommended not buying a tyre they had because it could be dangerous for us. It's great they care more about the customers than about selling things< /review>

<review>Same horrible experience as other reviewers. Avoid at all costs! Ordered tires, never got a call or email. System showed as having arrived so I called to find out only two tires had made it to the warehouse days earlier and they had no idea about the other two. ??? Never seen anything like this before.

<Text>Booked a "reservation" with them at 3pm. But don't think reservations are honored here. Silently observed when my car gets serviced and it was only after 4:30pm that it got into the working bay. Good news for the people who walk in. Bad news for people who make reservation in the hope for getting a timely service.< /Text>< Pics>

I ordered 4 tires online because I had bumps in my tire. The tires arrived on local Costco but they didn't give me a call or even an e-mail. After waiting and driving in fear for 10 days, I called them to learn the tires have been in the warehouse for 10 days. Finally, I lined up in early morning in Costco tire center for an hour to get them installed. They told me, the tires are of the wrong size! They still didn't offer any solution ! After driving with faulty tires for 12 days, my award was a refund! I will never deal with them in the future</review>

Here is an amazing place. At first, I came here for my car has a Neil and broke one of my front tire. After I came here, they told me that I had better to change four tires instead of change only two tires. But, why should I change four tires since my two tires are pretty new. Then I asked them to only change two tires( they told me that my tires are not in stock and I have to order for two weeks). After a week, I came here to repair my tire. Then, I haven't drive for a mile, my car shows that front ties is not in good condition. What a COINCIDENCE. They told me that my another tire is broke just now since I drove out of rode, not even a mile. How do I know if they accidentally broke this tire and didn't tell me after the broke it? I came here ask them, none of them give me a normal face. All of them are like I own them millions dollars. Never came here change tires here again. Even buy tires here, not change in here.<//text>

<text>Except for the long lines which is a normal thing at Costco everything is good, I had a nail stuck in my outer rim of my wheel and it took just 4 hours of my car at costco and 11 dollars to get it fixed. Amazing price value for the fact they mount your wheel for no charge if you leave your with them.<//text><Rating>4</Rating><resp>None< /resp></record>

Go to costcotireappointments and schedule your appointment. They might not have your tire in stock. Possibly save you a trip and time from having to go back and forth. Friendly customer service too</Text>

I don't want to pay hundred of bucks for a pair of new tires as my tire is 80% new still. I went to another store later, they charged 45, not cheap, but repaired my tire within 20 minutes, and it works well for 2 weeks already. So secondly, they provide fruad info for my repairable tire, maybe want to sell me a new one.< /review>< pics>

Service takes for ever here. You have to wait and wait and wait until someone comes out to help you.   Very understaffed location.   Even if I go during slower hours,  they have less workers, the wait ends up the same.   Really horrible manager is in control .<//text>

<text>Prices are on par with other locations but free lifetime tire rotation makes it worth it. But arrive early - they open at 7am and people line up at 6:30. After 8, expect a 3-4 hr wait.< /text>< pictures>

<text>I arrived at 5:00pm. They refuse to provide me service. Mind you, for a shop that is open until 8:30. This is my 2nd time. They can at least take the tyre and repair it next if they have backlog. I’m very disappointed. Please train your employees how they interact with clients. The supervisor was treating me like a kid.</text><Time>1531967347139<//Time>< GmapID>

Manager's don't have time sense to provide counter people to service at 7am-9am. So expect to wait atleast 20 minutes per person ahead of you. There are always atleast 4 "Members" ahead of you at 730AM. So If you are planning to get tires replaced even with appointment, take half day off to save $70 on their tires.
Costco membership means person who asked 3rd grade service at costco.Sunnyvale costco tire center is a joke.</Review>

Extremely busy place. You always need to wait in the line for more than half an hour to get the service. There are not enough people on the counter. The personnel are slow and typically there is a long time to wait for your car. Don’t just stay here during the tire change.< /text>

<Text>Amazing staff and dentists here at Sacramento Dentistry Group. I was greeted, checked in and roomed in a fast and efficient manner. Maria the dental assistant was so kind and friendly.

Marie is amazing. She is so sweet and gentle.  Dr. Karavan is the best. I’ve been so nervous to go to the dentist after a bad experience and they have really shown me a whole new light.  I have been back 3 times since my initial emergency visit and I will keep coming back.  Thank you for taking your time and not doing more than you have to. I really enjoy how friendly everyone is and how comfortable they make me feel.  The pillow and blanket is a nice touch to a cold sterile room. They are amazing with cleaning and wiping down everything between patients.< /text>

<review>Great service, friendly staff. The staff are great, always willing to work around your schedule and squeeze you in if needed. Will also work out payment plans for those who need it. Doctor G is amazing, its very evident he enjoys what he does. He makes sure everything is perfect from start to end and always asks for your opinion. Very pleased and will recommend this place to anyone looking for a great smile.< /review>< pics>

<Review>I absolutely love this dental office!! Everyone is extremely nice, respectful, and welcoming! The office is really clean and organized, and they have been so helpful in scheduling the best appointments for me. Dr. Marjoorie Castro is an awesome dentist who cares about her patients and is extremely knowledgeable. She always does a wonderful, precise job and is so very sweet! I am so lucky to have a great dentist who is caring, and an office that is also honest about pricing and cost. Best dentist in Sacramento!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Shockingly underwhelming. When I pay for a cleaning, I want it to be done by a Registered Dental Hygienist (RDH). Why? Well, they attend school specifically for the task of cleaning teeth- at least a year, and longer in most cases. Then, they are certified by the state. This practice is all about efficiency and maximizing profit. A dentist spent a max of 10 mins on my “cleaning” that consisted of primarily a cavitron and 30 seconds of hand scaling that was laughable. I was then handed over to a dental assistant- I never saw an RDH. Why does this matter? Well, dentist spend a minuscule amount of time on “how to clean teeth” in dental school and a dental assistant is not allowed to do certain procedures or use certain instruments that really give you a good cleaning, hence the necessity of an RDH to properly do the job.

And you know what’s sad? The dentist had loupes on and I know he could see the calculus on the back of my teeth that I will now have to feel on my tongue for the next 6 months. And if it’s that bad on the surface, who knows what lies under my gums. Where else are they cutting corners? This is absolutely unsatisfactory and you should not go to a practice that does this.< /Review>< pics>

Came into the office for my first time teeth whiting. I had Marie as my assistant. She is so friendly, explain everything and walks you through the process of what she is doing. The staff really makes you feel welcome. The girls upfront are so friendly and make you feel like you are home. I have sent 3 coworkers to Sacramento Dentistry. Try them out!!!<//Text>

<text>I’ve been a patient at SDG for 2 years now and every time that I’ve come in whether it’s for a check up, a cleaning or serious work they always take great care of me. I’ve always had really bad anxiety going to the dentist because of past work that I have done at other offices over the years but when I met Dr. Castro that changed everything. Dr Castro is amazing!!! She’s very professional, very kind, and has taken very good care of me since I’ve been there.<//text>< Pictures>

Sacramento Dentistry Group is fantastic. Dr.Castro did my root canal and I had a great experience. Who would have ever thought that getting a root canal isn’t actually as bad as all the horror stories we’ve all heard. She was gentle and made something that sounded dreadful, comfortable.<//Review>

I LOVE this place. The doctor and assistants really comforted me and were so patient with me every step of the way. I’ve already referred a friend to them and she has an appointment next week. They take great care of you and go above and beyond. I have very bad anxiety and Tracy (I believe was her name) made sure I had headphones to listen to my music and would rub my arm to calm me down. I’ve never had a better experience with any medical appointment.< /Review>

Each person I’ve encountered at Sacramento Dentistry Group has been warm and welcoming and kind. And it’s seems as though they’re just genuinely great people and not because they have to be. Going to the dentist isn’t my favorite thing to do. I’ve had poor experiences in the past preventing me from stepping foot into a dentist’s office for several years. This team of folks has made facing my fears easy. Still not my favorite place, but if I have to go, this is the location I want to be.
I’d recommend them to my friends and family for sure.<//text>< date>

<Text>Friendly staff and doctors. They have a benefits coordinator who will explain how much of the procedures are covered by insurance. One stop shop for tooth pain: scans, evaluation, and treatment - all in the same visit. Clean, modern, fresh office decor. I fell asleep during my procedure, that’s how comfortable I was.</Text>< Time>

Dr Castro hooked it up

I came in after i was unhappy with the service from my prior dentist office. Im very happy i transfered office's. I came in because one of my fillings had fallen out. Dr Castro recommended a root canal and a crown, she did a wonderful job, no broken drill bits inside the tooth (which happened during a root canal at my previous office). Great calming atmosphere, im very happy i switched offices, worth a 30 min drive. Good dentist are hard to find< /Text>

< Review>
Dr. Guerro and his assistant are incredible. I’ve had two root canals and all of my fillings replaced here about a year ago, and have not had any issues. They are really compassionate and caring, and always ensure you are comfortable during the procedure. Today I had a cleaning with Lee, and he did an amazing job! He was so gentle I didn’t feel a thing, but my teeth feel perfect and clean now. I am so happy to have found a dental office that I trust and enjoy visiting. Everyone is kind and welcoming, even the front desk staff. I really appreciate this business, and highly recommend it to anyone who’s looking for excellent dental care.< /Review>

<time>1600725583011<//time><pics>None<//pics><Review>I would like to inform you that because of your offices change in my dental care plan and your increase in pricing while I was a patient has led to my needing a bone graft. I made a plan to extract no#30 and build a bridge. But your desire to extract more money and try to convince me that I was lying about an already approved future dental plan, forced me to abandon your office out of fear and frustration. after 6 years of being in pain I finally had that tooth extracted today and because the infection went into the bone, I  needed a bone graft. The next step is my needing a crown on a tooth that Steele filed down to the nerve. So I have to spend another 5K to fix the work that this office failed to do properly.
This office FAILED to provide correct dental care and has caused me to spend more money to repair the damage you caused!

I went to see Dr Castro at the Sacramento Dental Group and I am very impressed with the service that I received there. I was a little nervous because  I needed a root canal treatment. She has a gentle touch and I didn't feel anything during the whole procedure. I felt I was in good hands. Thanks Dr. Castro, very professional.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I’ve been coming to the Sacramento Dentistry Group for over a year now. Dr. Castro seems to be a perfectionist and conservative in her approach, which I really appreciate. Dental assistant Tracie is a rock star! I really haven’t met anyone I didn’t like from the pleasant front desk assistants to dental hygienists. My appointments are always on time and handled efficiently. Recently I needed a crown redo. They fit me in the next day and made sure that the new crown was exactly the way I liked it and the perfect shape and color to match the rest of my teeth. I’m happy!</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

I have had a wonderful experience at Sacramento Dentistry Group. I received a consultation for invisalign, teeth cleaning, and dental fillings with Dr. Guerra. All these services he provided me were exemplary and the other staff members from reception to the Dental assistants were very friendly and helpful. Additionally, the office is a very comfortable and positive environment, the equipment and technology is state of the art, and staff members are willing to go the extra mile to ensure you are well taken care of and comfortable. For example providing you with sunglasses and a blanket while getting your teeth cleaned.  Dr. Guerra was professional, friendly and kind, very knowledgeable, and a great educator. I had full confidence in his knowledge and abilities and was very happy with all the services he provided. I would highly recommend this practice to family and friends or anyone who is looking for high quality dental care.< /Text>

This is by far the best dentistry office I have ever been to. I have a massive phobia and fear of the dentist from prior experience and am so happy that I found Sacramento Dentistry. Dr. Guerra was very accommodating and patient in what ways we can continue my treatment in a way that I am comfortable. Lisa, the dental assistant, was also beyond amazing and SO kind. She made personal connections and made me feel like she genuinely cared about my concerns and comfort level. Also to note, the first dentist I've been to that after I leave a filling and feel like it's evenly shaped and they did the best job possible. They really care about the details and the patients here. I will continue to come to this office as well as reccomend anyone who is looking for a dentist in the Sacramento area.< /review>

< review>
BUYER BEWARE. This practice will do anything in its power to scam you. I went in for my initial exam earlier this month. They did the usual-took x-rays and evaluated my teeth. Next, the dentist (Dr Guerra) told me I needed a crown and 2 fillings. He also said my teeth would fall out if I do not get braces. He showed me pictures of highly degraded teeth while in the chair which seemed like blatant scare tactics as mine actually look pretty good and haven't had any issues for years. They then handed me a quote while still in the chair that they wanted me to sign which was for approximately $1,300 out of pocket. I told them I would get back to them about it. I then called my insurance (Delta) and read them the codes given to me on the quotes. Delta told me that they were all covered. The next day I called this dentist office and informed them these procedures were covered with a small co-pay. They denied my claim and would not even consider talking to my insurance or sending them a pre-authorization form. Their only explanation for this was that my insurance didn't cover it and that their costs are too high to be able to do it for that price. This was enough of a red flag to know that this would not be my dentist any longer. I also asked why they told me my cleaning would be $37 despite my plan providing me with 2 free cleanings per year. They said they do not perform the free cleaning unless I also pay out of pocket for the fluoride which is $37. (They didn't even perform the cleaning). Fast forward two weeks later, I went to a dentist who actually has decent reviews on yelp. This dentist informed me I absolutely did not need a crown or braces. They also performed my cleaning on the first visit and didn't sell me a single thing (including a forced fluoride treatment). In hindsight, I should have heeded the terrible reviews on this page and steered clear.</review>

Excellent experience. Dr. Castro does top-notch work and doesn't push me to have unnecessary work done. She and her staff are wonderful about answering my pesky questions  :)  and  she always makes sure I feel good about having whatever procedure done. I never feel rushed or pushed. Best of all, my teeth are looking nicer now than they have in a very, very long time.
Update: this dentistry group has the gentlest hygienist I have ever had. Lee is the hygienist I wish I had all my life.
Another update: At yesterday's appointment, I had more questions about my teeth and gums than usual, and Dr Castro answered all of them thoroughly. I'm very grateful for all the information she gives me because it allows me to make good decisions about treatment options. The rest of the staff is very helpful, too. This is an outstanding dental office.
Yet another update: I came in with a chipped tooth for Dr Castro to repair, and I am amazed at how real the restored tooth looks. There is no difference at all between this restored tooth and an untouched, natural tooth. Wow. She is truly an artist.</Text>

<Name>Emiliano Berntsen</Name><review>I came here for my biannual cleaning. Instead of giving me what I had an appointment for, they send a dentist out to examine me and tell me I need $5,000 worth of work done. So after an hour and a half at this place, all I got was a dentist who seemed more like a salesman than a dentist, and no cleaning because they didn't have time. Ok....so you have time to try to sell me procedures I don't need for an hour, but dont have time for the cleaning WHICH WAS THE REASON I CAME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. Unbelievable.</review>< userid>

I am pretty religious about going to the dentist every six months for a routine check-up and every once in awhile I will have a cavity. I went here for a simple check-up and ended up spending two hours here. At this appointment, Dr. Castro basically told me how screwed up my teeth were. She stated that I had 6 cavities, needed 3 root canals, jaw surgery, and I needed braces...again. I walked out there with a treatment plan costing over $4000 out of pocket. I cried because I was so upset and never had a dentist who they told me my teeth were so bad the way Dr. Castro did. I didn't even get my teeth cleaned.

This dentist office only cares about one thing and one thing only, your money. They don't care about their patient. DONT GO HERE!< /text>< pics>

After have a less than positive experience at another dentist office, I went  back online and found Sacramento Dentistry. They were able to fit me in first thing the next morning.  Everyone,  from start to finish,  was super nice,  knowledgeable and professional.  They took complete x-rays and pictures to look at my teeth both ways. Dr. Mercado did an amazing job at assessing my behaviors and issues based on my teeth. He went through the plan of attack, so to speak and was able to take care of my immediate problem , a root canal, right then. Thanks to him, my pain is gone! I am so grateful!! Thanks  to him and the rest of the staff,  I am not as scared of going to the dentist.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Stay away from this place at all cost. I'm considering making complaints with the BBB and the Dept. of Consumer Affairs. Went in for a gum graph surgery and I felt all of the pain as the knife cut my palate. I was in agony as I gripped the chair handles for dear life. I felt like I was in a SAW movie and the surgeon was jigsaw. The procedure was extremely longer than it should've been. This was due to the surgeon double dipping and providing a consultation with someone else during my procedure. They put so much pressure holding my lips down I had to waive my hand to have them stop as the pressure was just too much to take. They shoved the suction so far my down my throat I must have gag nearly a dozen times. Never in my life have I gagged in a dental office.</Review>< pics>

I believe that this dental office is dishonest when it comes to  discussing your insurance options. I believe that they intentionally leave out cheaper options and only provide options that are more profitable to their practice.<//text>

Don't  ever go there! worst place ever! They will do everything thing they can  to as much money out of you as possible! Called to schedule  an appointment  for my son and the  receptionist  collected  all my insurance  information including  my SS#. When my son went to the appointment  they charged him $275 for a filling and wanted  to charge him $80 for a cleaning. That raised a red flag right away cause with my insurance  coverage  we get 2 free cleanings a year. I then went onto my insurance  company's website  and luckily  I  was able to print out  my benefits  and how much some of  the  services  are depending  on  what code  they are billing  for. I went into the office  myself  and spoke with Marina who told me that they  were billing for D2393 and that my out of pocket  cost was 275 dollars.  I then pulled  out  the paper of my benefits  and seen that my cost  was only $75 and when I showed  her the paperwork  she got really  nervous and said " Oh we have the wrong  insurance  listed for you"and said that there was also an other  code that they were billing for that my insurance  didn't  cover and that  was another  75 dollars. I figured  okay it was a simple  mistake  and made another  appointment  for my son to get another  filling  for another  tooth and a cleaning  that was ordered  by the orthodontist  so my son can have braces placed. The day before a receptionist  calls again  to insurance  information ( they should  have had that information  from the last  visit) My son goes  to  his appointment  and I  decided  to  check  in  on him and asked him via text if they were  going to  clean his teeth and he responded  no another  appointment  needed to be made for that. I then called my mother and asked her to please tell them  that  the appointment  was not only for the other filling but also for a cleaning. I also asked her to please get me something  that had the  codes that were going to be used for billing. When I got home from work I looked  at the "treatment  plan" and seen only one code on there for billing, the same code that was used last time that was only $75. So I called again  and spoke to a receptionist and asked her what code was being  used  for billing. She gave me the same code that was used  the last time. I then asked her is the the only code you guys are billing  for  and answered  "yes" I then said okay then you guys need to refund  me some money cause I was  charged  $ 140 she then placed me on hold and when she came back she said " oh no we also used a different  code and that was not covered  and that was 75 dollars" I  then told her that on the treatment  plan it only had one code for billing and she has the stupidity  to say "well you can come it and I can give you a receipt  that has both codes on there" I said no both codes should have been on there to begin with and plus the last I knew 75 + 75 =150 so you guys  are  liars and I am turning  you guys in!< /text>

I have gone to this dentist office and its affiliated office in Placerville for 9 years. While I loved the Placerville office and staff, that isn't the case with Sacramento.  I made an appointment for an expensive in-office teeth cleaning.  I took off 3 hours from work, drove across town, paid for parking, and arrived on time. After a 10 minute wait, I found out that they did not have the gel they needed.  Their stock hadn't come in. They tried to send me home with trays instead! While they were apologetic, what they should have done was call me as soon as the problem was known, rather than blaming it on the back office.  They should have offered me a huge discount for wasting my time, instead of expecting me to simply reschedule.  Expecting me to just accept an apology and return tells me that they don't understand the customer service concepts of taking responsibility and making amends.  They did not show any respect for the amount of time and effort I spent to get to this appointment.  My time is valuable.   I will not return.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

Do not trust these people. Call your insurance to verify every single charge. I paid 200 for a filling which was covered by my insurance and today I went in for my first cleaning of the year and was told I would be charged 40 just for the cleaning and another optional 80.00 for fluoride!! Confirmed with my insurance and they said no charge, 2 free cleanings a year and no copay for fillings!! Such a rip off. The dr is nice but inexperienced. Best thing going for this place is a really nice looking and clean office interior.<//Review>

I have been coming to this dental office for six years.  I have had checkups, cleanings, root canals, Invisalign, and most recently, my first ever extraction.

The ladies at the reception desk are friendly and professional.  They're very knowledgeable about my insurance, what it covers and what it doesn't.  Everything is explained to me clearly, including cost and alternative treatments if the first suggested treatment is a bit pricey.

The office is beautiful.  I've never been offered free beverages at a dental office before.  In the examination rooms, they even offer pillows and blankets (it can get a bit chilly).

Lee, the hygienist...what a pro.  He's the greatest...quick, thorough, and gentle.

As for Dr. Castro, well, all I can say is she's an angel of mercy.  My best root canal experiences have been in her capable hands.  (She won't advertise this, because she's too humble, but she was a **top** dentist in another country before coming here.)

I'm so glad that when I recently needed an extraction, Dr. Castro was the one to perform it.  She was understanding about my apprehension and was so gentle and kind about it.  I'm not exactly a wimp, but I was stressed out that day.  Dr. Castro relieved that stress with her stellar chairside manner and her expert skill.

I just can't say enough good things, and I hope I never have to go anywhere else!< /Text>

< Review>
John knew the part number of the thermal fuse for my Duet dryer before I even told him. When I told him I also needed to replace the thermostat, he told me that rarely was necessary. I had heard the same thing online, but I was super impressed that he didn’t seek to make more money off me when it would have been very easy. Believe me folks, this combination of knowledgeability and honesty in a businessman is increasingly rare these days ( we used to take it for granted in this country, but it’s fast disappearing). I will never get my parts from anywhere else.< /Review>

I needed a refrigerator door seal replaced and was told that it would cost $300 to replace it so I should just buy a new refrigerator!!! What?!! I don’t think so Tim! So I did me some web searches and found out that it only takes about 1/2 hour start to finish to do it myself. Me being the gear head that I am called Appliance parts Co. and ordered a new seal. What’s super amazing about this place is that they are very knowledgeable about parts. The person I spoke with on the phone found the part in no time flat and ordered it for me with out even asking for a C.C. #
Later I remembered that I have a broken pull out in my other refrigerator so I decided to go to the store and talk with them. When I got there I was greeted with smiles and “long story short” he ordered the pull out drawer in 5 min after giving him the make and model. PEOPLE, PLACES LIKE THIS ARE LIKE TRYING TO FIND A NEEDLE IN A HAY STACK, THEY ARE SO HARD TO FIND “thanks to the internet” PLEASE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM AS THEY ARE A RARE COMMODITY THAT WE ALL NEED.</Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I went in with the part I needed and before I could place it on the counter, John knew exactly what it was, went to the back and came out with what I needed. The entire transaction took a few minutes and most of it chatting it up about fishing. I will always recommend this place to others as they are super knowledgeable and friendly!<//Text><Date>1620150111989< /Date><GmapID>0x808fcb5d0e69aea9:0x46b3337da2374409< /GmapID><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

Excellent customer service and good price. My Maytag Alantis dryer timer didn't work. I called the store and John helped me to find the dryer timer and dial knob for just 60 bucks ($270 Maytag website). I picked them up this morning and replaced them in just 10 minutes. My dryer is up and running well now.
I would recommend this store to everyone. We all should support mom and pop shop. Once again, thank you John for your help.< /text>

The part I needed was in stock, with multiple options - the basic version and the deluxe version. The basic version (at half the price) was better for my application, and so that is the one they suggested - zero upsell, just an interest in what is best of the customer. It's very hard to find integrity like this anymore.</text>

I called Appliance Parts Co and they answered. Very friendly on the phone. I ordered the part I needed, which came the next day. I received a call stating the part was in. Turns out, I made a mistake and ordered the wrong part. They made no fuss about it and happened to have the part I needed in stock. Very kind service. It's the sort of service that makes you smile as you're walking to the car after.</text>< pictures>

<review>Very helpful and respectful to their costumers. I needed a switch and a knob for my stove. He didn't sell me the knob and instead he fixed it for free. I got the switch from them at lower price compare to  another electrical supplier. The lady even squeezed some sanitizer on my hand after signing my receipt. Very honest people! Thanks to John and his wife.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<response>None< /response><review>Needed a ice maker and tried online twice.  Then I remembered Appliance Parts Company and how they always got whatever weird appliance part I needed when I lived in San Jose.  I called (and they were open yay #lockdown days) on Wednesday at 9:40 with the refrigerator model number and received the call Wednesday at 10:57 that the part was ready for pick up.  25 hours is really fast and my wife will be very happy to have ice again.  Idea: skip the hassle of wrong parts from online and order it from John at Appliance Parts Company.  It was the most easy pleasant shopping experience I have had since the #lockdown, also right now lots of parking right out front.<//review>< pictures>

<text>This is the best place in the South Bay to buy your appliance parts.  If they don't have it in stock (which is rare), they can usually get it the next business day.  In fact, I called when they opened at 8:30AM and they had it ordered and ready for will call by 1PM THAT SAME DAY!!!.  Incredible service.....very competitive prices.

These guys are AWESOME!!  They had every part I needed for my 11-year-old dryer. They didn't have the timer I needed in stock - so I called Friday around 3 PM and they had the part for me Saturday morning at 8 AM ... and for 30% less than the largest online parts supplier.</text>

<Review>Went down to get a fridge filter replacement. They had it on-hand and at a great price. Also, they were happy to chat with me about a fridge leak issue I'd been having, offering advice without being pushy on selling their own services or parts. I'll definitely be back for any other appliance parts I'll need in the future.<//Review></record>

There is a appliance parts shop closer to where I live, but he has consistently over charged me for parts. I traveled a little further to this shop and I'm glad that I did.  It is organizedorganized and clean.  The owners were friendly and had my part waiting for me when I arrived.  The parts were agitator dogs for my Kenmore washer and the price was 1/3 of what that other guy was trying to charge.  I will shop here from now on for my dig fix it projects.  Thankful🙏</Text>

<text>My dryer didn't start and I opened  it to check what's was wrong with it. The belt pulley was really worn out that it pop out of its place. I search online for the part but, it would take long to arrive. I came here to get part and they had the part. I was able to fix the dryer the same day. I will come back again if one of my appliances breaks again and need a part.< /text></record></dataset><record>

They were extremely helpful to me when I work on restoring my vintage O'Keefe & Merritt. I already knew some parts wouldn't be easy or possible to find so I didn't them to pull out a miracle. But they were very willing to offer me guidance, advice and names of other possible businesses if they didn't carry what I needed. They even dug around in their 'scrap' bin for odd vintage bits and pieces which they gave to me.<//Text>

This place has pretty much every part you might need to fix things yourself - and if they happen to be out, they can order it quickly. Great local resource  for DIY.<//Text>

I have been going to North Bay Auto for decades. I keep going back because I completely trust them in every way. They are professional and very competent. Yesterday I bought tires from them and received the best price possible. In addition to installing them, they did a quick maintenance check and noticed an issue with my brakes that I had been ignoring for months. They also reinstalled a protective seal to the underbelly of my car with no charge to me. I feel very well taken care of and have complete confidence in them! They have taken care of the last four cars I have owned and I will always be faithful to them.</Text>

I was bringing it in because my car was randomly overheating. The initial meet was very nice and I was excited to have my car worked on. I brought it in around 11 and did not hear anything back til around 4. When they called, they said they couldn’t find anything wrong with my car, said they would replace my thermostat for me. When I received my car back after spending $460, my check engine light was on, and the car was running unbelievably rough. A lot worse than it was when I brought it in. I immediately called and asked if I could come back in. They did not charge me for this which was nice. When I received the car this time around, the battery holders were just sitting on top of the battery, not holding anything in place, the coolant cap was not on, and it just felt like there was a lot of incompetency for $460. Not to mention, my car is still randomly overheating, so the initial problem is still a problem. I could have done all of this on my own, a lot better too, and really just feel let down as I was relying on using that car for the weekend.< /Text>< Name>

<review>July 2020

Northbay Automotive at 929 Petaluma Blvd S, Petaluma, CA 94952 has once again out did itself in service! My scheduled appointment worked around my activities with ease.
Don knows my vehicle and is always ready to give me outstanding service.
I dropped my vehicle off and before I walked home Don called to say the work was done.
Northbay Automotive is honest and trustworthy!

Northbay Automotive at 929 Petaluma Blvd S, Petaluma, CA 94952  Is a wonderful and trustworthy establishment.  Don has been my contact for many years for automobile service. Professional, efficient, honest, and genuinely good describe the folks at this shop.

Most recently, I had my truck in for service while I was out of town.  Don kept in contact with me throughout the day!  My truck was repaired under warranty and was made available upon my return after working hours.

Honesty and integrity is how I describe Northbay Auto. Don and staff do a yeoman's job!

Thank you for great service.

Post dated for service on 28 April 2020:

The team at Northbay Automotive is outstanding!
I called with an issue and Don told me to come right in. He would squeeze me in as soon as possible. How great is that! What fantastic customer service.
Everything was explained clearly including an estimate of time for completion.
John came right over to evaluate the issue and recommend parts to be ordered. This was an incredible use of time. John continued to complete other work while the parts were ordered and awaiting delivery.
A call to inform me that my truck was ready and no surprises in the cost.
I highly recommend Northbay Automotive!< /review><UserId.>103617966421088631687< /UserId.><time>1595974396656<//time>< Name>

Our 2008 Volvo has been a regular here since we moved from the East Coast 4 years ago and needed an inspection for California registration. Whether a simple oil change or a more complex motor mount replacement, they know our car, can fix it, and do so cheerfully, quickly and at a reasonable price. It is so nice to have a local place we can trust so we can avoid the dealership as much as possible!<//text>

This is the second time I've taken my sweetheart car( 2008 Volvo v70). To them. Made an appointment , they looked her over fixed what was wrong, and got her back to me.  I find them honest, trustworthy, easy to talk to, and not charging me for work that didn't need to be done. Being retired I will be using them for all of my car needs. TOP NOTCH!!!

The car was towed in around noon and I was out of there by 3:30! The waiting room/office was the cleanest I've seen in just about any repair shop. The reading materials were varied and there were enough for multiple customers. They were also quite nice about accepting a check from me because my SSI check wasn't going to be deposited until late that night. And, if you're hungry, there's a very good diner next door that closes at 2pm.< /text>

<text>I brought a Tacoma in for a pre-purchase inspection and they were friendly and accommodating, but they did not catch several significant items. A slow leak in the valve cover should have been caught while inspecting the engine compartment and leaks in the rack and pinion
assembly should have been observed when inspecting the underside and  shocks and struts. I subsequently purchased the truck and paid significantly to have those items repaired.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x8085b14d11fbed69:0x46a9324280619ac5< /GmapID></record>

I had a check engine light on and the car was idling rough so I called Mike the night before and although he was very busy, he told me to bring it in the next day,  and he would have the mechanic get to it before end of day. He did and when I did pick it up, it was running fine.

I've been using these guys for 20 years and have always felt like my business was important to them and they did a consistently great job.

The independent service centers always have a higher bar to climb and Northbay does it very well.</Text>

Having your car break down while out of town is stressful but the staff at this shop made it as easy as possible. I got some good advice about driving there before I got there.
I arrived at about 2:30 and they had the problem diagnosed and fixed within 2 and 1/2 hours. I was expecting to have to leave my car overnight so I was really pleasantly surprised. I also received a AAA discount. The staff are very friendly and made me feel at ease.< /review>

I had a shake develop with my front brakes. I called Northbay Automotive and explained the problem and they told me to bring my truck in so they could take a look at it. Even though they were very busy they found time to diagnose the problem and repair it.
I’ve always received outstanding service from these guys.</text>

<review>I am a new customer of Northbay. My car was sluggish to start and the starter died. I dropped off the car during a Sunday after reviewing the location online, at which point my car died. The next morning, I called and was told I would have a diagnosis on the problem that afternoon.

I did not receive an estimate until four days later - a bad starter, at which I was quoted a price of $500 to fix. Upon reviewing repair pal, I found that a similarly priced starter replacement in the area was $300. When I brought this to the mechanic's attention, he pointed out the price of the starter, which was $279. Since I had little recourse to get the car back, I paid, but found that the same starter was priced at $60 after getting the car home. Upon further review of the estimate, I found that the price of the estimate had been revised from $237 to $500.

While the work done on the car was solid, I cannot condone the way they took advantage of my situation. I suggest that if you're a new customer, you stay away from this location.</review><userid>113550848959368071932<//userid>< GmapID>

<UserId.>106021264908458832315</UserId.><Text>Simply the best!  These guys are true locals, in that they give Petaluma the kind of old-town service our grandparents expected from their local mechanic.  They are knowledgeable, fast, affordable, and trust worthy.  They won't sell you something you don't need.  And the prices are so good that when I call to pay my bill (when picking up my car after hours), I sometimes forget to even ask for the total, because I know it will always be less than what I'm expecting.  They service all our vehicles, no matter what model or make, and we even buy our tires from them. Although a bit more expensive than Costco or Big O for tires, we go with Northbay because their service over the life of the tires will far exceed that of Costco, Big O, etc., and in the end is well worth the price.< /Text><username>Houston Porter< /username><pics>None< /pics></record>

<text>Deja Vu!  While shopping, the tire pressure light came on, and worried us.  So it was off to trusted NorthBay  right away.  Sure enough a nail that would have destroyed the tire if we had waited.  Dismounted, plugged AND patched and back on the car in a matter of a half hour!  The very same thing that brought me here a dozen years ago for the first time, and made me a very loyal fan since!</text><rating>5</rating>< userid>

<Review>I recently relocated to the Corte Madera area for Employment purposes and did not have a vehicle. Northbay Automotive, not only worked within my budget, more importantly the Staff of Northbay Automotive had a Great looking Car for me. Now when its rains i no longer have to catch the bus. Today, Northbay Automotive has me riding in style with a 2013 Chevrolet Impala  that runs and Looks Fantastic. They even had a Loaner vehicle i drove to work for Two weeks until my vehicle was all set to go!!! Looking for a car but don't have the money and don't want to drive some beater around? Contact Northbay Automotive THEY WILL HELP YOU RIDE WITH A SMILE!

<Text>We needed our air conditioning fixed, and Northbay made an appointment the same day.  They gave us a quote and then called with a cost of the repair so we knew what to expect.  Their customer service was very good... professional, kind and prompt.  I would heartily recommend them to anyone needed prompt work on their car.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I've been a customer of Northbay Automotive for 20 years, with 4 different vehicles (Saturn, Subaru, another Saturn, and Prius) over that time. From basic service and tires to diagnosis and repair of tricky intermittent problems, they have always been great at convenient scheduling, reliable repair and follow-up, and good communication. I also wanted to mention that Northbay Automotive (one word, on the south end of town) is not at all related to the fleeting existence (?) of North Bay Automotive (two words, north end of town) which arrived a couple of years ago, and proceeded to get bad reviews and confuse people.   Stick to the south end of town folks, and you can also enjoy nearby eateries. (Mr. Mom's, Aqus).  I realize I'm sounding like the Chamber of Commerce, but I'm not. I'm a neighbor, and am happy to have good businesses in my 'hood.<//Text>

I have been taking my vehicles to North Bay Auto for service for twenty years now. The latest repair was this week, when the manifold in my Buick Encore had to be replaced. Mike not only gave me a ride back to my house after I dropped off my Buick, he picked me up again when the repair was complete. He had given me a detailed explanation of the design of the manifold that made replacement necessary when a vacuum seal leak occured, and even showed me the defective manifold. In my younger days getting vehicles serviced was dicey. I wasn't always sure that I was given a fair deal, and a few times I was aware I was being ripped off and took my business elsewhere. I have a lengthy relationship with North Bay Auto because these people are honest and dedicated to doing a job well.  I am secure in the knowledge that I am treated fairly and my vehicles are kept in good running order by this group. They have my highest recommendation.<//Text>

< Review>
Called Affordable Brake and Tire to schedule an appointment, I was told to bring it in the next day first thing in the morning. I took the car in and told Domingo that the car is making a rattling noise. The is very noticeable, can not miss it .  Around 2:30 he said did not hear any noise and does not have time to diagnose any further and to schedule an appointment in two weeks. I did that. Two weeks later I Deliver the car to Affordable Brake and Tire at 8:00 am. Around 3:00 pm Domingo calls and says cant’t hear any noise, but then in the same sentence he says the noise could be coming from the back end of the engine. Domingo tells me I should take it to the Toyota dealership to figure out the problem. If he would told me that the first time I took the car in I would not be writing this. The problem here isn’t that he can’t fix the car it is the time I have wasted. In total I have wasted 3 weeks not having my car repaired. My time is worth something too!!!< /Review>

We had the check engine light come on our 2005 Nissan truck and the mechanics did an excellent job in fixing the problem - that another shop couldn't figure out. We got our truck back quickly and at the agreed upon cost. I have been to many other shops and this place goes above and beyond for their customers. Our truck is running great now and we would not hesitate to use them again. Thank you Affordable crew!!</Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Domingo and his staff really can't be beat. He's a great mechanic but more importantly you can trust him. If you don't need something, he won't recommend it. My family has been going to Domingo for well over 10 years and every time we refer someone to him they stick with him. There's a reason for that<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Brought my wife's car here when it was overheating. I dont know the first thing about servicing a vehicle myself, but Domingo was happy to come outside and teach me a few things about it. The last place we came from wanted to charge $100 just to look at it... Domingo refused to accept any payment outside of the $20 bottle of coolant. Very honest, great ethics.< /Review>

An advertisement outside said, "Allignment Special- $49.99!" When I got up to the counter to sign papers, the price jumped to $59.99. When I asked why, they said that the special wasn't going on any longer.

Well then take that sign down! Unless you are just dishonest. You are suppose to honor the price advertised. I won't be back.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

DO NOT GO HERE!!! THEY ARE CROOKS!!! I was sent to them by a different tire shop for a minor $30 lug bolt replacement. The guy who sent me told me it would be about $30 total for the repair. When I get to "AFFORDABLE" BRAKE & TIRE the girls in the office told me it would be $180 and take two and a half hours to repair. I immediately left "AFFORDABLE " BRAKE&TIRES and I went straight to DISCOUNT TIRES where they completed the job for $29 in about 20 minutes!< /review>

So ive always recomended this place to all my co workers and people i know, but when i took my car in to get it checked due to oil leak.the owner told me that it was too dirty you need to steam clean. Your under carage befor i work on it..i was like ok that why im bringing it to you so you can figure out the problem.seemed like he didnt want to work on the car and sent me on my way.what kind of mechanic shop does that after im a repeted costumer.so i took it to discount tire on mooney and they told me exactly what was wrong with it.A TIRE shop figured out my problem..and told me i need a new valve cover gasket. No need to steam clean my  under carage they knew exactly what my problem was in less then 30 min, i will no longer bring my bussines hear to affordable Horrible costumer experience..</review>

It is a pretty good Chinese market. It is smaller than other Chinese markets, but it is closer to my home. The prices & services are quite good. They also keep the place clean. The only thing that I am not crazy about is the parking lot & there is only one entrance & exit making it tougher to drive in & out the property. It can be a safety issue for customers walking &/or driving.< /Text>

<Text>They having a soft opening. It's  pretty cool to have an Asian market near the house. Have a lot of Asian food selection. Hopefully this place stays clean. The best part is the sea food selection. Plus they clean and fry your fish for you.<//Text>< pictures>

<rate>4< /rate><review>The selection is great i was so amazed when I stepped in i looks like a tourist more than a customer live seafood in the back and even a wall of shame so don't expect thieves. The only reason I wouldn't give it five is because i had a hard time communicating with the staff i was asking on of the staff about lobster and i frankly don't think he even spoke English so yeah 4 stars for me good selection bad communication.< /review>< pics>

<Text>I’m glad to finally have an Asian market near home. This store provides good seasonal vegetables and fruits at a fair price. They also have pretty good seafood and meat, but the service in the seafood and meat department is bad. You cannot ask any questions, and some of them display bad tempers if you try. For example, I asked a question about a seafood product and the man not only refused to answer but also asked angrily if I was going to buy it or not, and if I wasn’t then I should leave! He was so rude! They don’t respect customers here.<//Text>< Rating>

<review>Great place to buy specific Asian Items. Staff is friendly and helpful. Price is lower than the larger asian market near by. Also when you spend a certain amount they give you a promo item which i think is missing in grocery stores these days.

I went here to buy live lobsters and steak for my camping trip when I asked for steak even though there was plenty in the display case , all I got was the person shaking his head no... After a back and forth i finally got the steak. I went to the lobster tank and asked for 6 lobsters, they reluctantly gave them to me then when I went to the front counter the meat department called the front register to make sure that I was paying where I was also told that I can only pay in cash not use my bank card even though somebody else who was purchasing food from the same Department was able to use their card I was discriminated against there and it felt bad I felt bad for the whole weekend. DON'T SHOP HERE IF YOU'RE BLACK!<//Text>

It's like a 99 Ranch, just 11 away. My favorite part is the Hall of Shame of shoplifters. My least favorite part is there's only one entrance/exit and it's pretty narrow.</Text>

New Asian supermarket with abundant fresh fruits, local and far east. Good place to shop for fresh seafood with wide variety of selections. Cleaning and deep frying of purchased fish is available free of charge to customers.< /Text>

This is a great store for many Asian foods. It has a good selection of various foods. However, due to supply chain issues because of Covid-19, there is not much of things. So you should go early to get things you need. It also could do a better job of limiting people in the store. At times, aisles were cramped.< /text>

<Text>This grocery store recently opened in my neighborhood, now I don't have to go far to shop for my Asian stuffs.  Well stocked (as far as Asian foods go) and reasonable priced make this place a pleasure to shop. It usually a little more crowded weekends.  Check out the fresh fish department,  they even fry them for free upon request.  Credit cards accepted.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I went for shopping today the cashier signed my signature to pay the amount. Upon asking her why she signed for me she was scared and the other cashier was there saying to her you can’t do that. I asked both of them that I want to see your manager they one said she is not here and the other one said she is at the back. I tried to call the manager only reply I received she is out. So be careful shoppers< /text>< Pics>

I cracked it open, the meat was yellow & everything else was black/brown. I am very dissatisfied, $18 down the drain.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

A tad smaller than Ranch 99's but it's a neighborhood gem.  Quick in and out for fresh foods and vegetables to fix at home.  The place is clean and bright.  I'm amazed at the selections.</review>

<Text>I appreciate to have an Asian market close to home. I just wish they would lower prices of grocery items and have a better driveway than what it is now. There's only one place to go in and out and it's even narrow. Staff is friendly. Hope it's not just because they just opened. Good luck!<//Text>< user_id>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>I love that we have a place nearby for (eastern) asian groceries. I mostly go here for korean and thai cooking sauces, rice, ramen, and meat. The butcher here is great. I buy all my pork here. It tends to be fresher, of higher quality, and cheaper than what I used to get at Safeway.

Dont expect to find many standard goods that you'd find in large chain, non specialty grocery stores. You might be looking for russet potato but instead find 3 or 4 types of sweet potatoes. You might be looking for cheap sandwich bread and find that these guys have only high end sliced bread that's more in the $4+ range. You also won't find a big variety of beverages  that you might be looking for, like chocolate milk or cranberry juice. But they have 50 different beverages you've never seen, many of which you probably dont realize you'd love if you've never spent time in eastern Asia.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Finally open! Very clean and manageable size.  Really excited to finally have decent grocery in Hayward.  It's still their soft opening, so some of the shelves are not stocked yet.<//review>

<text>Just opened their doors yesterday (1/18/19) and looks good so far. Their Magnolia Ice Cream is cheaper than anywhere else!  Because they just opened, the place still looks clean, even though the floor is old and has not been refurbished.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The only minus is that there is only one way in and out of the parking lot, and the driveway is right next to the corner traffic light, so could be challenging during busy hours.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808f957a19dc8517:0x519dbb3f6e499fa8< /Gmap_id></record>

I cannot say enough good things about these guys. I purchased a 2010 Mercedes E Class from them about 3-4 weeks back. Purposely waited this long to leave a review to allow enough time for any hidden issues with the vehicle to reveal themselves. There have been none, none at all. The Car has been solid, no dash lights, no weird noises while driving, everything works as it is supposed to. This has easily been the best vehicle purchase I've made to date. The process leading up the the sale was also handled masterfully and professionally. I reached out about interest in the car and explained my situation, I live out of state and needed help finding financing. They worked with me and helped me every step of the way to secure the financing I needed. Allowed me to leave a deposit and make sure the car I wanted would not be sold before I was able to pick it up. Even waited for me after business hours while I flew in to pick up the car. When I arrived The vehicle was presented in a showroom like fashion, I was allowed to test drive it before signing anything. Overall I had a very pleasant experience buying from Prime Auto Solution and can easily say they are the best and most trust worthy auto salesmen I have dealt with. I would highly recommend them to anyone who will listen and will definitely look to them first for my next car purchase. Thanks for the awesome experience guys! If I could give more stars I would.< /text>

I am glad we came to these guys! What I can say is that we had an amazing experience with everything! First of all, customer service is on high level, they are professionals in their field, cars they have are very clean, and condition is good too. They were helpful in financing and all other staff. Love my new BMW, these guys and place!</Text>

<Review>This is by far the best car dealership experience I have ever had, by a longshot. Artem and John are respectful, polite, and downright genuine. They take as just much care of their cars as they do their customers, and they went above and beyond to accommodate me and offer me amenities I didn't even ask for. This dealership deserves your business and you won't regret giving it to them.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSsuEjMK8FGoEmjsIexd3MFklaw6i8XKPSLYO-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

Artem and John are great guys. They were really helpful in our purchase of Lexus LS 460L. During COVID times when travel is difficult and we being in PA, it would not have been possible without Artem. He was available for FaceTime and go over details. The buying process was smooth and transparent. After dealing with dealers around PA, NJ, NY - this was such a good experience dealing with someone on the other side of the country. Artem even coordinated the shipping of the car to me here in PA amidst bad weather. I would recommend them
to anyone looking for a transparent car buying experience.< /review>

Artem and John are amazing car guys my situation was changed from difficult to easy with artem helping me every step of the way.

I found a specific 7 series M package car with all the options I desire in a bmw. I call and find out that even though my credits 800 that if I travelled to California and tried to purchase a car with an out of state address It would be hard to get 0 down. Artem then spent 5 minutes explaining other options, I took his advice and ended up on the highway and arrived to find a collection of cars that are immaculate! He got me my keys and paperwork and I signed after my test drive. I have bought many cars and this team at prime is more honest than any dealer or individual I have ever met. I highly suggest using them in any car purchase especially a European car. No wheeling a dealing needed here because they are plain honest! Thanks guys!</review>

I have recently had the most amazing car buying experience from this dealership. Artem was the most helpful individual! I just want last week to test drive a 4runner that they had. I called them before I came and when I got there and it was very simple to take her out for a test spin. There was no pressure to buy or anything! Artem gave me his card and said if I need anything else, he would be more then happy to help. Ive had my eye on a 4runner for years and I can finally make the power moves to get one. I want back the next morning and bought my dream car! 15 minutes and I was out the door! These guys are extremely smart, patient, reliable, and genuine. While I was there, there was another gentleman that was telling me how he only buys his cars from Artem and John. Very good vibes and very good cars! I’ll be back in the future for sure!</review>

I had been looking for a specific model of car when I found it at Prime Auto Solution at the best deal. I filled out the contact form on their website and John got back to me right away to view and test drive the car. The car itself was in great condition and was exactly as listed. Artem helped with the process of buying it and finding a financing option that would work for me. They made the whole process easy and were patient and knowledgeable in the vehicles that they were selling. Will definitely remember this place when I or someone I know is looking to buy a car. I'm really happy with the experience and my s5!</Text>

From the loan to the point of pick up.

I left with the vehicle I wanted and I am very happy with the purchase price.  I would recommend Prime Auto Solutions to anyone looking for great deals and great customer service.  I look forward in working with them again on my next car purchase.<//Text>

We purchased a car from Prime and it was an amazing simple process and a gorgeous car! We went to Carmax and all the normal dealers and it was awful procedure and not even close to the quality of cars!  The owners that run Prime are so calm and easy and enjoyable to work with. They only carry top of the line older cars with low miles. They had so many I wanted I couldn't decide! Went in for a BMW, started to buy a Lexus until a gorgeous Mercedes rolled onto the floor!  Paperwork, warranty and all the buying process was smooth and calm with NO high pressure.  Highly recommend this company and this lot. the worst thing you will experience is not knowing which beautiful car to choose!<//text>

I have been buying vehicles for almost 50 yrs. This was by far  the most pleasurable experience I've ever had buying  a car.  They had no problem with me driving the car to my own mechanic in Poway.  The transaction took appx 15mins not hours !  If you are looking for a quality high end used car I HIGHLY recommend you contact them.</text>

The owners of Prime Auto Solutions really made this an excellent experience from start to finish. They had the car I was interested in just freshly cleaned and washed, waiting out front for me when I arrived. They truly provide high-end vehicles that they personally hand select with low mileage. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and if I need a vehicle in the future, I will definitely be back. Thanks for the BMW X5, I love it and it's going to be an ideal family car for me and my son. It's really nice buying from honest people, thanks again!</review>

Purchased a vehicle from them. I was really impressed at how professional they are. The cars are clean good running vehicles.   I came all the way from Los Angeles to buy the car I wanted, and they held it for me. I would definitely buy another vehicle from Prime 👍</Text>

We were looking for a very specific model, and the one at Prime was spotless with a completely clear carfax and reasonably priced. We took it to BMW of Escondido for an inspection, and our service rep said all of the techs were impressed with just how clean it is (no issues were found either). We will definitely be back when it's time to buy our next car.

<review>The site has a "make offer" button but this dealership is firm on their pricing. I inquired about a vehicle and they couldn't even do a dollar less than the asking price. You should remove that option from your site and state the price as FIRM if thats the case.<//review>< time>

< Review>
I'm from another state (MA) and bought my Lexus from the dealer 10 days ago with an intention to drive back in MA on it by my own and have a pleasurable trip back home. Guys thoroughly prepared the car for me, all paperwork was done within two hours or less, they got a car temporarily registered to me be able to drive across the country. They behaved very professionally. All went through seamlessly including my 5-day trip! I'm extremely satisfied with their top-level service and my new car. Thanks, guys, I wish you tons of new satisfied customers as you really deserve!</Review>

Purchased 2011 MB ML350. Excellent condition.  Great price. Terrific service. Allowed me to take to my own mechanic for inspection before purchase--found an issue. I was a bit worried about buying with a promise to fix. Prime took care of it the day I brought the car back for repair.<//Review>

John made it very easy for me to find the location, to locate the car on the website and Artem processed my paperwork fast and smoothly for my automobile purchase. Excellent service. I would recommend purchasing an automobile from Prime Auto Solution. Also the prices are very competitive and the cars run smoothly.<//Review>

Bought a 2014 Mercedes from Artem and John at Prime Auto Solutions in early August.  Background checked before meeting them and they are spotless.  When I got to their dealership, the cars were just as impressive.  My car is in outstanding condition, with 73k miles, but looked new.  Then I noticed ALL of the cars were shiny and well kept.  They clearly take pride in their inventory!

When was the last time you purchased a car and drove away thinking, “That was a really good experience?”  It had been a long time for me too.  A month later, and I am still reflecting on how great the whole process was.  Artem walked through each document and made sure I understood the entire transaction – no typical rush through.  All the details were handled up front and clear.  I had forgotten how FUN buying a car can be. The whole thing was great and I am looking forward to the next time I can do business with these great people.< /review>

Artem and John were incredibly professional and welcoming, at no point did I feel pressured or like they were trying to persuade me in any direction- the owners were very straightforward and tried to assist me in any way possible. The car was in phenomenal condition, and came at a very fair price. They also gave us advise on what to do with my beater car and how to handle private financing. I've already begun recommending them to friends!< /Review>< gmapID>

This place is amazing, Artem was the rep that assisted me and he was so polite, so helpful, he explained how my Fico score affected the interest rate, told me everything I needed to know about my vehicle and was honest about everything. He was also very quick and responsive. When I could not afford the vehicle I initially wanted he helped me find one that fit my needs.<//Text>

Prime Auto Solutions is a great dealership.  John and Artem since my first inquiry about their cars have given me the best customer service you could ask for.  Their car selection is mostly, if not all, luxury brands and models.  I first started looking for car using online tools, and their dealership popped up on many of the searches.  I ended up purchases from them due to their great professionalism, price, and selection.  No pressure, easy buying process.  I would recommend them for anyone looking for luxury brand cars.< /Review>

Just purchased a BMW X3 with Prime Auto Solution after an extensive search for the right car over the last month. They were by far the best used car dealer we dealt with in terms of presentation of the car, professional manner, honesty, integrity and a fair price for an excellent car. Delighted to give them a throughly deserved five stars.< /text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>I purchased a 2007 BMW 550i from Prime Auto Solution. From the moment I called and inquired about the vehicle to the day I went to pick it up, I received top notch service from John and Artem. I have purchased several vehicles in the past and this was by far the easiest most pleasant car buying experience. I was on vacation when I found the car online and I did everything online. The whole process from financing to finally test driving the vehicle was very easy. Not once did I feel pressured to purchase a vehicle. As a matter of fact, I inquired about the vehicle on a Wednesday and was not able to physically see the vehicle and test drive it until the following Tuesday, but Artem knew I was extremely interested in it and would most likely be purchasing the vehicle if everything was good. He told me not to worry that he would not sell it. He had a lot of interest in it but kept his promise and did not sell it. They have beautiful, well maintained luxury vehicles on their lot and have the best prices in town. I highly recommend them. I will definitely be going back when it’s time to purchase another vehicle.< /text><name>Wanda Moore<//name><Gmap_id>0x80dbf56adbb7c57d:0x7a05416832b4d8c8<//Gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating><Date>1563506111350< /Date>< Resp>

This man stayed up until last midnight just so I could pick up my car. He went above and beyond. Very trustworthy dealership and I will definetly be comming back. The car I bought was in pristine mechanical and cosmetic condition, and he gave it to me for a good price. All of the cars on the lot are gorgeous, absolutely no junk in sight. I wish I could give more than 5 stars.< /Review>

<Text>From start to finish, top notch service. They have a beautiful selection of well taken care of luxury vehicles. We had our eyes set on the Infinity FX 35, and boy, it did not disappoint. John was very relaxed and not pushy whatsoever. The test drive was a dream. He also detailed the car before handing it over to us. We already had financing through Navy Fed, so that expedited the process with Artem, who was a real pleasure to just chat with during the paperwork process. We opted to purchase the 3-day decide to buy coverage for $250, which was not needed lol, but we got peace of mind. Took it to my mechanic that I’ve been seeing for over a decade, and after the inspection he said “great car!” Whew! Icing on the cake! Enjoy that fine dinner Artem and John, you both deserve it, and your reputation speaks for itself. Looking forward to our future business endeavors. Thanks guys, sincerely , Adam & Monica!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

Little lot, spectacular vehicles, excellent customer service!! I don’t see how anybody would be disappointed through any of the process. I even had pre-vehicle inspection. If I was younger I’d be doing backflips. Being older I’m doing the running man 😁👍< /review>

We went in with the intention just  to test drive the car but left driving the car. We purchased a used BMW  X5 couple weeks ago and the process was very easy and comfortable. Have no issues with vehicle!!  Got the car of our dreams at a great price!! It wasn't our first time dealing with used cars but I didn't feel pressured to buy!  This was the best car buying experience we have ever had! Will be back for future purchases!<//Text>

Just drove off in my '08 Infinity G37 Coupe and couldn't be any happier with the car or Artem & John.
I looked all over San Diego & Indio and no place could come close to the service, quality & pricing of vehicles that these two provide. They delivered on all aspects of the deal. If your looking for a late model luxury car, with no sales pressure to buy, this is the place. Their inventory is amazing...
I highly recommend Prime Auto Solutions, already looking forward to purchasing my next vehicle from them.
Thanks guys!!</review>

I’ve had a troubling credit history due to a recent bankruptcy. I’m rebuilding my credit from the ground up. Artem and John were very effective in informing me on how to rebuild my credit. Not only were they effective but it was also fun interacting with them. I left Prime Auto Solutions with the vehicle I wanted and am happy with the purchase price. I fully recommend Prime Auto Solutions and I’ll be working with them again on my next car purchase.</text>

<Review>My family was in need of a new car as soon as possible when our ‘98 Camry decided to finally break down. Artem went above and beyond in helping us find the right vehicle for our current situation and they found us the best financing that could approve us. We’re so thankful we found Artem and John.< /Review>< gmapID>

Working with John and Artem was super easy!  Not only did they go way out of their way to ensure that my Mercedes Benz was solid, they also fixed minor sensor issues at their cost before I picked up the car.  Their personal energy, attention to detail, quality of product and ease of doing business with them definitely places them above what is normally experienced when buying a vehicle.  Thank you guys!  Wishing you much success!

****i need to add that I told these guys that I needed a dependable long range vehicle for my summer travel.  The gl550 had a couple minor problems.  A fuse, a light, nothing serious......the “boys” said bring it by on my way out of town and they would fix everything and they did!
I tried to pay them and they refused money.   Grateful! ❤️😉.<//text>

< Review>
Artem is an honest guy and easy to deal with. I purchased a car from him and everything in the buying process were seamless. I had a hip surgery couple of months ago and I can't find anybody to be with me to pick up the car  because I live far from him. Guess what, he offered to deliver the car. After few hours him and his wife arrived to my house. I think nobody can beat that deal. So if you are on the fence of buying high end car with fair price,  look no furher prime auto solution is one of the best if not the best.  Thanks Artem I am a very happy camper yesterday, will buy again in the future.  :)</Review>

<Text>Having bought a number of cars in my 36 years (CarMax, big dealers, small, private party...) Artem and John provided the best experience, and most confidence I’ve ever had in car buying. Having conducted a nationwide search for over a month into a 3-series convertible, these guys had the best and cleanest example of what I was looking for...and shockingly at a very fair price. Having done so much homework, it was relieving to know that these guys had it right out of the gate! The readily available CarFax confirmed a not just clean but well serviced car. I asked them about it and without flinching, John acknowledged that they would rather turn inventory than sit on a higher price, and that they just don’t buy cars without a clean CarFax. About two weeks prior I had driven to see a different car somewhere else where the guy had lied about an accident (or the guy that wouldn’t budge on a wildly overpriced car...or the guy that didn’t even bother washing the car to hide the bodywork that was done...) so these guys really are unique. All communications were prompt, professional, and on visiting the shop I knew they took pride in their fleet and knew “how to pick them”. They specialize in the types of vehicles they carry and that means they know all the details. Peaking around I think I’ll be back for my next car! They were gracious with the process, and even drove the car over to BMW for a 3rd party inspection. The techs were “wowed” at how clean it was and they had done any light repairs up front. Discussing financing was honest, fast, and helpful. Paperwork was a breeze. Highly recommended.< /Text><user_id>112405813284057710365</user_id>< Pics>

I've already had some experience with buying cars and my last one with  Prime Auto Solution  was quite possibly the best one I've ever had. They were waiting for us after business hours and  friendly held the car for my family next couple days.  Recommend to everyone who are looking for a nice clean car for very reasonable price. Thank you guys!!!< /Review>

<Text>Big things come in small packages! Well in this case a small dealership that can provide like the big boys; what I mean by that, the big dealerships. I must say that I was Skeptical at first, but please let my experience with Prime Auto Solution be your solution to wipe out any doubt! Purchased a car for my wife and things were rough for a moment. No ,my wife did not have bad credit she has great credit but her debt to ratio was the hurdle. Artom and Joe handled the situation with wisdom, experience and education which led us along this trek. The lot of cars they have are well maintained and really exquisite. All their used luxury cars slaughter all competition. I just could not believe how well kept the vehicles were let alone the paper description of the vehicles.I’ll put it this way, if we didn’t receive the car I would still be writing this stellar review. On a greater note we got approved for the vehicle and we were in and out with gratitude for our experience that Prime Auto Solution showed us.</Text><Time>1566592415388</Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmapID>0x80dbf56adbb7c57d:0x7a05416832b4d8c8< /gmapID>< UserId.>

I bought Toyota Sienna last weekend from Prime Auto Solution and absolutely love it !! Artem and John both were helpful throughout the buying process. They went beyond the expectation and help me out with secondary inspection @ Toyota Dealership and guess what car comes clean as what they promised !! I would definitely recommend them to all my friends and family :) 5 star rating for their excellent customer service :)</Text>

<Text>Highly recommend this dealership. Artem and John were extremely sweet and helpful. Great customer service. I’ve been to many different dealerships before I came in to this one. I would say they have the best cars and prices in the area. I bought BMW X5M from them. Car is clean, drives perfect and it lookes amazing. Would recommend to all of my friends and family this dealership!<//Text>< Pics>

It was time to buy my dream car and Prime Auto Solution had it. I scheduled a test drive and drove the car home that day. Prime has a great inventory of the best cars out there but I was there for my CLS63 AMG we made a great deal very painless the guys at Prime were very easy to deal with no pressure and very professional I highly recommend Prime Auto Solution if you want a high end car and no hassles when you want honest and straight up service check out Prime

<Text>I purchased a pre owned Mercedes from Prime Auto Solution. The sells men was so helpful and disclosed all information that was available to him. He took the time to show me all the records he had and explain all my options. I purchase the car and left the dealership with high regards. I thank Artum for all his help and the time he gave me to help make my decision. I would recommend Prime Auto solution, for anyone’s next purchase of a good used car.<//Text>< pics>

Terrible to deal with.  I was purchasing a car and found the exact one I was looking for.  I was actually looking nationwide but this car is a little more rare.  I did my credit application.  Once approved I set up an appointment to come down and see it.  They said it drove great and tthe only problem was that the gps did not work.  They said they were having it fixed.

I confirmed with them that that I would be there in 30 minutes as scheduled.  I arrived at the place and nobody was there.  I called their number and another guy answered and said the other salesperson was on a test drive.  Guess what, they were selling the car I had already made a deal on.  I ended up test driving it and the air suspension was no good.  It is an Lexus LS460L and it bounced around like it had zero rear shocks and pulled extremely hard to the right.  The repair for it is about $5k.  They never even called back.  Terrible dealer.  Go to someone that you can trust.  These people are very slimey!< /Text>

<Text>Never thought i would be writing a review for a dealership. I know it sounds cliche but hear me out. Im a first time buyer for a car and the owner of this dealership,Artem , is very humble, knowledgable and kind and last but not least very straight forward. Im fully satidfied with my purchase of the cobalt blue cayman s that he had for sale on his lot. Its very clean. I was in a rush when i picked it up, and he offered me free service for the car for whenever im available to drop it off to him. Anyway to the point, this is a new dealership as far as i know but trust me, you wont be disappointed by your overall experience with this place. Customer service top notch.
Satisfaction 100%
Overall atmosphere 100%
He never once tried to upsale me or give me bs about cars, like used car dealerships always do.
He specializes in german cars, porsche, mercedes, bmw, etc.
He is being very helpful and offering hook up prices for whenever ill need something done for my car.
I've been to many dealerships and i gotta say this is my favorite so far.

<review>I recently had the pleasure of buying a car from this dealership. The ownership is run by two brothers Artem and John and so it is a family business.

Let me first say that they had the absolute best pricing for the Mercedes model and year I was looking for in all of San Diego County (and even all of California and surrounding states). When I was looking for the model I wanted they actually had 2 potential cars in stock both at prices far below the competition. I believe Artem has many years of working auctions and so they get the best cars out there at the best prices.

When I wanted a mechanic to take a look at both cars Artem was very helpful in bringing both cars to the mechanic that I chose and both cars were great cars and the Mechanic said they were both in solid condition. Artem and John must be good at selecting the right cars where they buy them and both had low miles.

Lastly, I had a few special requests and they saw the entire transaction through and truly treated me like family. I felt they totally went out of their way to make sure I was confident and comfortable with my purchase. Artem even stayed very late at night at work so that my wife who had a late night at her job could come see the car and test drive it.

They also threw in several extra service items that I wanted last minute at no additional charge.

In short, I highly recommend them and after many years of buying used cars I can say this was my best experience. I test drove 4 other more expensive Mercedes at other car dealerships and they were no where near as nice as the one I bought from Prime Auto Solution.

One note, when I picked up the car from PAS, it was detailed to perfection -- either Artem or John must have a professional background in detailing. It shows. The car was like new and beautiful and smelled like a new car inside, waxed, etc.

Thanks guys! David.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

First time visiting Stevie Dee's, very nice place. Service is very friendly and welcoming. Menu has a good variety to satisfy the palate. The servers are awesome. The food is delicious. It wasn't too busy for a Sunday afternoon,  cant tell you about the rest of the week. I'd recommend hitting this place up if you haven't been. Enjoy!!!</Review>

OMG!  You have to try their Chili Verde. It is SO good. The pork is very tender and the sauce is so tasty and a little spicy. So much better than anywhere I've been.  And it's all meat. They don't fill it with the fat pieces of the pork. I hate when other places do that. BUT,  They also have great biscuits and gravy, pancakes, French toast. Even their hash browns are great. Hash Browns are usually just a filler on the side of the plate but here they're actually good. And dinner is great too. My kids love going there and the rest of my family does too. You can go for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and get a great tasting meal and a large portion for a low price.<//Review>

Ordered for the first time on a Sunday morning. We ordered 2 Sausage burritos, spinach omelette, and bacon mushroom omelette. They were all delicious. The burritos are huge with plenty filling. The eggs and sausage were fresh and still hot even though we picked it up 10 min after it was ready. We wanted to support the smaller businesses because of the dictator Newsom is trying very hard to bankrupt them. We were glad we we ordered. Will visit again</review>

From phx and passing thru. Try to avoid chains and found this cafe not far off the freeway. Walked in and even though server was busy she greeted us, said to find a seat wherever we liked and right away a gentleman got our drinks. We order 5 different meals all delicious and good portions. She was extremely friendly and tentative. We appreciate the great service Veronica< /Text>

They never rush you with ordering or bringing the check. My favorite night to go there is Tuesday when the full size tacos (not the street taco size) are only $.99. You have the choice of ground beef, carne asada, or chicken and all are good. The tacos have enough overflow of lettuce, salsa, and cheese that you have a mini side salad left over. Try Taco Tuesday for the best bargain on tacos in town. The homemade soups are great with chicken noodle, vegetable beef, and clam chowder leading the list.</review>

The sauce had a nice flavor but there were 6 tiny morsels of meat on top and  none inside, only cheddar cheese. Chicken fried steak was way overly breaded with a thin slice of meat inside.

Horrible  service once they take your order you wait for over 30 minutes for you your good . Than you get up to ask and its another 10 minute wait.  Now I know why we go to Johnny O's better service by far. Definitely won't be back to this place.</Review>

I wouldn’t even give this place one star if I could! I’ll never go to this place again! We were regular customers that came every weekend consistently for the last year and a half! When I picked up my boy from the school behind the restaurant, he needed to use the restroom and I took him to Stevie D’s To Use the  restroom because I figured I know them well enough and the lady stopped me at the door and told me that the restroom is for customers only! I said I come here all the time you don’t remember me? Again she says the restroom is for customers only, so I had to walk my boy to Starbucks across the parking lot! They lost me as a customer because they have no Sense of passion! Money Over Passion! Not From Us!<//Text>

Went to breakfast for the first time here since new owners.  I had the waffle with whipped cream & peaches cuz I saw a picture online & it looked wonderful.  Not at all like picture!  Not even sure it was really peaches they were so mushy & whipped cream covered them (again not like pic!)  And the waffle had to be cut with a knife cuz so rubbery...not cooked enough or not fresh.  Won't go back.</text>

<text>We had another great lunch together today! Sorry forgot about the photos! Will remember next time, but the spinach/swiss cheese omelette with a touch of avocado on top is simply Devine! They have biscuits & gravy so tasty  to me no one can match it! Plus smooth coffee, yet it's Farmer Brothers, of course  . . . for my pallet, the best! The server remembered us from last time, even what we ate! Wow, she's GOOD! THIS TIME TOO . . ! EXCELLENT  . . .</text>< Pictures>

I hardly ever rate fives stars; I only do that for establishments that I find exceptionary. The food isn't special, it's quite ordinary just regular food cooked right, which is surprisingly rare. The food is even chapter than you'd expect cheaper than some fast food restaurants. The food tastes home cooked. The atmosphere gives a diner feel you'd never think such a thing could exist in a strip mall. You can see into the kitchen when you walk in, and the cook may even greet you with a wave and help as you come though the door. The staff are great and kind. Honestly, I could write a huge review. on how good they are but it's one of those things you'd have to experience yourself.<//Text>

<Text>Food is great but literally did not like the blonde girl who just right now told us the place was closed at 6:45pm when it clearly states that it closes at 8 online. Her reason was that she has been there since 6:30 am and "its been a long day" mind you I was at work way earlier than that and was just getting off too and was annoyed that I took the time to drive there and make a stop because online it says IT IS OPEN TILL 8....would be 5 starts for food but this was annoying.</Text>< rating>

<review>Nasty!  Slow service ice tea weak and food not even fit for a prisoner in the big house!!  This was our first visit to Stevie Dee's and most likely will be the last.  Wait staff is overwhelmed and it appears as though they just wait on any table which makes it impossible for the other waitress know whether the customer has been waited on.  Lots of work to do Stevie Dee's.</review><date>1566070358405< /date></record></dataset><record>

I never felt thus way in my life. Worst service and even the owner had a race issues. I was the only white person in there and from the start the staff didnt give me the same respect as in tone of voice as did to others. They  did not know Spanish too. So yes they were calling me white boy in Spanish . And if they were correct with talking to me differently then what they did to other of a brown color skin.  I wont ever go there again. And if I can I will be filing against them at city hall and better business bureau over this. I am from this country and I speak both languages.  But they didn't know that.</review>

I have never experienced a better taco Tuesday. $1 tacos and oh the cheese. The owners are amazing. Very friendly. The breakfast is off the chain and oh the portions are insane. You won't be able to eat it all. If you wanna really eat something delicious try the Pastrami Melts & Tuna Melts. Brian and Thomas are awesome and keep my drink full!!! They earn my tip Everytime!<//Review>

Ok I don't want this review to sound negative, because its not in any way.  The food is good.  I've had better, but for the price, you really can't beat it.  The food isn't BAD in any way.  It is straight forward classic American cooking with no frills.  If you want what I would call a farm style breakfast... this is your place.  Nothing fancy, no secret sauce, or magic spice.  Crack an egg and cook it.  Shred some potatoes and cook em up.  That's what this place does.  The portions are extremely generous and the food tastes fresh.  What more could you ask for?</text>

Where do I start the service has been declining ever since they changed owners. I have been a customer for at least 6 years and the service was ok, but I have experience really bad customer service several times. Yesterday been the worse one I show up with my family and we were waiting and waiting to be helped even though they knowledge we were there after 20 minutes and witnessing the attitude from the owner towers another customer regarding her drink we left and decided to go  find a different café.<//text>

There tacos are not the same at all...i miss Steve he was an amazing person always there to greet you and make you feel welcomed. The tacos tasted like straight oil. The meat was way to greasy and they hardly put any meat. I remember when I use to order 3 tacos I would be full and still have enough left over food out of the tacos to make another one they put like a pinch of cheese..very dissapointed I do not recommend. I would never go back again< /text>

I ordered the chili verde burrito for the price of that burrito was ridiculous quality of it and size total rip-off. I could have went to Del Taco and got a bigger burrito for a cheaper price and taste a lot better. Server was nice quality the food that's a good question I don't know if it was just that burrito or is all the food like it I'm not going to go and find out.</review>

There is no wrong occasion to come dine here. It's a great scenery with rather affordable meals of huge portions. Bring your parents and expect to take a foam tray home after the meal.< /Text>

<Review>Stevie Dee's was hyped up before I had gone. My experience didn't meet the hype. I had the country fried steak and eggs with a biscuit and gravy. Everything was just ok. Bland. Needed salt, pepper and hot sauce. On everything. The service was also just ok. I'm going to give this place another shot due to my girlfriend and her daughter's loving this place. They are basic white girls. Which makes sense lol.< /Review>< rate>

<Review>Several years ago we tried the at that time new Stevie D's couple of times and weren't very happy with it the food cuz didn't seem to be the same as the original and the cleanliness and all wasn't very good so few weeks ago we decide to try it again.

< Review>
I was in the mood for breakfast for lunch, and not from a fast food venue. Within my route of travel, I decided to check in at Stevie Dees Cafe, and was not disappointed.  Their menu offered quite a variety of options, eventually settling on a polish sausage breakfast burrito featuring a sausage gravy covering. When it arrived, I was pleased by the generous portion. What a delicious  indulgence lunch became. So glad I was in the neighborhood. Thanks so much, Stevie Dees!</Review>

<Review>Definitely won't be coming here again. Ordered bacon and eggs for my toddlers and an omelette for me. Food was really bland, and took ages to come out. Coffee was ok, but had to ask for creamer.< /Review><response>None< /response>< userid>

Homemade soup,  generous portions, flavorful dishes & breakfast served all day?  Not likely to find elsewhere!</Review>

First time I went it was great, but this time it was very bad. Waitress needed a new job not working with customer, had to ask several times to speak with manager. After asking so many times, she came back saying manager was gone but unsure when he would be back- as she said this the manager shows up. He did apologize about her attitude and slowness, gave us our food free and asked us to give the restaurant another try. I was not looking to get food free, just good service and food.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Haven't been here in about a year.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I had the chili verdes with scrambled eggs.  I had asked the waitress before ordering if the chili verde was spicy.  I like my food spicy.  She said it had a kick to it and she was.right on spot.  It was some of the best chili verde I have had.

My wife had the steak and eggs.  The steak was the size of their large plates.   Not only was it a big piece of meat it was tender.

We will definitely be going back more ofte.<//text>< resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Brought new life to hard-warn 911 boots almost 10 years old.  Had the Resole Package completed and they never looked and felt better.  Did my own polish over the fresh factory for the extra shine and pop.   Be prepared to wait at least 1-2 months for their return, but completely worth it.  Easy to complete, will absolutely use again.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoMDrlSpqXH4yyaaG7YY0dpveLeWMbqagM285m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

What a great experience. The process is quick and easy. My boots look like new and the process was painless. I placed my order, printed shipping labels. My boots were back looking great. Thank you. The whole team is responsive and emails were sent to me from beginning to end.< /Text>

I sent them an old pair of stovepipe cowboy boots that I love and wear everyday.....they are like a good saddle and fit just right. These folks made them like new and the fit is just like that good saddle again and they are ready to protect my feet and work again. Thank you to the skilled folks at Nushoe!<//Text>

<Review>Amazing from start to finish. The only place recommended to replace the soles on my expensive hiking boots, (molded soles) was nushoe. It took awhile from sending off and return, but what comes back looks brand-spanking-new. Not only are your soles new, but your whole boot is spiffed up and new laces installed. I bought the package for that. Easy walk through system where you print out the prepaid FedEx label to send them with, is very helpful. Would definitely do again when necessary.< /Review>< user>

<text>I sent my shoes in the week before Christmas. They are the most comfortable boots a person could own, bought in Berlin and worn three years since. They came back new and familiar-- with all the old comfort, but refreshed with new solid soles. It took about six weeks, but who's going anywhere? They wrote twice, reassuring me that my shoes had arrived and were in process. Thank you for giving me my well loved shoes back!<//text>< Response>

I thought it was a little expensive, but after I considered the price I pay for a new pair, I decided the price was valid. Quick turnaround and fairly easy process. My boots came back just as comfortable as when I sent them in, but much cleaner. I really liked the look they had. Used and worked, but very well taken care of. I’ve already sent in another old pair I had laying around.</text>

<Review>I'd purchased a pair of Doc Marten's at a thrift store that were broken in, but the sole had started to come off after wearing them for a week. I tried shoe goo, which didn't work long, then took them to a local shoe repair store, but his solution didn't work long either. I ended up sending them to Nushoe and they did a beautiful job! I love the repair work they did on my boots, and now they'll last another 20 years. Highly recommend!< /Review></record></dataset><record>
<Text>When I first heard about the shoes, I was very skeptical on how it'sadvertised on social media.  But, I gave them a chance and purchased a pair. I read the reviews and I ordered half a size up than normal. I could have gone a full size up, but this will work. The comfort level of the shoes are very good and it's very flexible. The quality of the shoes looked good too. I wear an shoe insert for my heel pain and it is still comfortable. Definitely recommend them<//Text>< Pictures>

Excellent job on restoring my Finn shoes.  I had wore these shoes every day for over a year and they were totally worn down.  When they came back they looked and felt like a brand new pair of shoes.  I will be sending all of my Finn shoes to them.</Review>

Had Older pair of work shoes that fit like a glove.  I have trouble finding shoes that fit me well.  They were bought in the 1990's.  The soles needed to be replaced.  Sent to Nushoe and WOW came back looking great and feel great.  Only negative is the soles are wearing down pretty quickly.  I would pay more for a more durable one.  Over all VERY HAPPY.< /Text>

Sent out a pretty worn pair of Thorogoods and got the total re build package....a little pricey but compared to a new pair, could be a bargain.....received the boots back and was definitely surprised and pleased with the rework. Boots were almost like new. Will definitely be sending .ore boots to this place for refurbishment
Thank you for a fine job.< /Text>

I was skeptical of sending my work boots in, but glad I took a leap of faith.  It was convenient completing the work order online and printing the shipping label.  Customer service was very helpful tracking the status of my boots, and the workmanship is superb.  Very satisfied with my experience.  Thank you!<//Text>

<review>I’ve used them four times for my flight boots and will continue to do so. Much cheaper than buying a new pair of flight boots and when they’re done with them, it’s like getting a brand new pair of boots that are already broken in.

My only critique is that they recently changed the type of laces they send back with the boots. They used to provide nice brown laces to go with my brown boots, but now it’s just cheap black laces so now I just buy laces from a different vendor.

Highly recommended.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80d9464af26784b9:0xccafc0ff735fc1b8<//gmapID></record>

<Review>I have been wearing Thorogood (Union Made in America) for decades. They no longer make them in my size. I sent my oldest most beat up pair to NuShoe as a test. They did a great job. I've been wearing the resoled boots everyday for 6 months. The boots are holding up well. I'll be a return customer for sure. Thanks.< /Review>< userid>

My husband and I each had a pair of Finn Comfort Shoes refurbished. Caring for one's feet is a good investment. When our favorite sandals needed attention, Nushoe was recommended by our shoe store owner. We were both very pleased with the "new" pair of shoes.The workmanship was outstanding.<//text>

I really enjoy receiving my boots back from Nushoe. They look amazing compared to when originally sent and they endure for another 18 months. I've had several pairs resoled and I truly enjoy the service. Ken< /text>

Boots were awesome when I got them back. Took more time than I had planned but they were waiting on back ordered products. Biggest issue was they didn’t replace worn brass eyelets and they are constantly cutting my laces.</Review>

<text>Called Thorogood themselves & they referred me to this company because they are no longer making 4E sizes. This was my first time having a pair of boots resoled & Nushoe was very professional from start to finish. Very happy & if I had one complaint to say it would be that I wish they were Union like myself & that's more of a complaint towards Thorogood for even referring them. I was hesitant & like to support Unions hints why I purchase Thorogood boots. I'm not happy that they are not making 4E sizes but we are in a pandemic now & things have changed. After having them resoled I have to say I was super happy & will deal with them again. I have also told other Brothers about Nushoe that are going to be in my situation soon. They ask if they are Union & I have to say no but convince them they are good people & do great work. Us Union boys like supporting mom & pop small business as well hoping as they grow they will go Union someday.

Shame I can not give negative stars. Horrible horrible company. They have had my boots for months I have sent email after email after email and none have been replied to. I called to find out they were out of the items to repair my boots.  They would be restocked in May here we are 3 weeks into May and nothing still. They just ignore customers and blow them off.  Besides having my booths for 4 months now.  bad customer service would be an improvement because they have no customer service and these guys are representing ARIAT (Which is an excellent Company) to bad Ariat doesn't cut all ties with them and find someone else to use their name and authorize them to repair their products.  If you can find someone else to do the repairs then do so. picture shows at least 12 of the emails sent to and from of them not responding except one time and then nothing at all ever again..............</review>

< review>
I am not typically one to write a review, but I’m bummed...I sent my husband’s Thorogoods in to get a complete restoration. I was not pleased with job that was done when I received the boots back two months later, so I emailed and never received a response from the company. We ended up getting rid of the boots because my husband disliked them so much after the restoration. I had designated that I wanted a call if his exact sole was not in stock, but never received that call and ended up with a chunky, white, 70’s looking disco sole instead of the sleek comfortable sole he had become accustomed to in his original boot.

Communication is lacking and I wouldn’t pay $125 for another restoration. I’d rather spend more and just get a new pair and be satisfied.<//review>

<text>I have a pair of boots that I love and the model is no longer produced.  I found Nushoe and thought I would try it. They assured me the boots would be repaired with original materials or better than original. They kept me informed of progress through the tracking feature on their site. When I received the boots back they looked and felt like new (minus cuts or major scratches that I had made in leather due to wear). I only hope I keep them in good enough condition to have them reconditioned again if need be. Great first experience.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The recommended company to re-sole my faithful Thorogood work boots. Came back looking great with new soles, for less than half the price of new. Used boots have that great patina and are already broken in.</Review>

<review>I sent a request to get my boots rebuilt, I got the packing slip sent to my email very quickly (I think it was the next day) and sent my boots off within the next few days, the communication was very fast, with the next email saying that they had received them only a day or two later, next thing I got was another email about 2 weeks after that saying my boots were completed and would ship back to me within the next few days. I think the whole process took about a month from the time I initially contacted NuShoe to when I got my boots back. Very good service, excellent communication, and fast turnaround. I will definitely look to them for the next pair I need rebuilt, or repaired.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80d9464af26784b9:0xccafc0ff735fc1b8< /gmap_id></record>

I wanted to give a good review, but my shoes were ruined. And they don't make them anymore. I loved my shoes and I was hoping a full restore would give them the love they needed. Instead, my shoes came back with a new sole and heel cap, but the same old dirty insole laid over a newer layer of padding. This  made the toe area of my shoes too cramped and I could not wear my shoes anymore. Would not recommend.</text>

< Review>
I received my resoled Chippewa boots on 19 September 2020 and have worn them everyday since then. As of 13 May 2021 I have walked  1,167 miles on the new soles and they look like they are good for another thousand. I asked Nushoe to give me a longer lasting sole than the factory Vibram and they put on a Goodyear sole.

Very pleased - I'll probably send the boots to Nushoe again early next year for another Goodyear resole.</Review>

<Review>The entire process is about as effortless as possible.

Fill out the forms, ship the boots and wait for them to return. The wait not very long.

The tracking system is easy to use and a good way to keep yourself updated.< /Review><rating>5< /rating><date>1619700803260<//date><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

I've had my second pair of military issued boots resoled by NuShoe, and I am 100% satisfied with both orders. The boots came back to me in like new condition without the need to break them in again. I fully intend to have NuShoe resole them again when it becomes necessary.< /Text>

I was wrong, they were re-soled with a high density material that lasts longer than the original type.
My boots were pretty beat up when I sent them.
Nushoe did an awesome job of making my boots look great and better than the original. Plus you don't have to break the boots in again, they are already molded to your feet. Like getting an old friend back.< /Text>< time>

<review>5 year old ramblers that take 10,000 - 18,000 steps per day. This is the 3rd set of soles, 2nd replacement by nushoe. Nushoe also replaced the heel guard inside the boot. They are the best and the reconditioning makes them feel better than new. Nothing worse than a great set of leather uppers with no way to resole. I hope to keep these going as long as the leather holds up.<//review>< pictures>

Using the service via HAIX, was easy and painless.  Only complaint I have is the boots I don't feel were repaired as requested and specified in the description of service offered.  Re-soling was flawless, the toe cap was supposed to be repaired or replaced with the stitching as well and that was not completed.< /Text>

<date>1615299480762<//date><user>105367548643331997877<//user><text>The re-sole of my shoes was nicely done. However the refinish of the upper was not. I purchased the chairman's craft, and based on the work description, felt that was to be most appropriate for my shoes. However the upper was not buffed, still had all the original creases from my normal use, and had a dusty appearance perhaps from dried conditioner. I had to polish and buff my own shoes when I got them back.

All total I paid 130 with taxes and shipping for the work. Based on what was advertised and the results I got I must say I am disappointed.<//text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

I sent my beloved Finn Comfort Shoes off to Nushoe for refurbishing and new soles.  The shoes came back in perfect condition.  My only complaint is that it took a little bit of effort to figure out *how* to ship them.</review>

I had my Finn Comfort shoes resoled.  They look brand new!  The team was very professional and responsive.  I definitely plan on sending them more shoes to repair in the future.< /text>

I had a favorite pair of Birkenstock sandals, and the sole needed to be replaced.  As it turned out later, I also needed new cork beds (which added $40 to the cost).  However, overall, I could not be more satisfied with the result -- essentially, a new pair of Birkenstocks.  The repair job was truly awesome, and I was very pleasantly surprised by the fantastic job NuShue did.

I wish I could include a picture, but just imagine what a brand new pair looks like -- that's how good a job they did!<//review>

The boots looked great when I received them. It took about two weeks for the inside leather pads behind my heel to wear and break. Aside from that the boots look and feel great.<//review>

This is my second pair of work boots I had redone with Nushoe.  Their work is great and the finished product is as good as new.  I appreciate them fixing the one pair that had scuffed toes.  They placed an attractive leather cover over the top.  Great work.< /review>

I would have given a perfect rating had they not missed a very obvious needed replacement of a defective eyelet that stuck out in a way that made it useless. Less critical but also annoying was substitution of drab laces for the sporty and more durable originals.< /text>< pics>

I've used NuShoe for Birkenstock & Finn Comfort shoes . I was very pleased with the quality of the work they did.

Husband was about to throw out his favorite summer shoes until I suggested he send to NuShoe to resole & clean up.

Other than it taking longer than expected , the shoes are almost like new !

Would recommend to anyone who has invested in a good pair of shoes .</review>

<Text>My Finn Comfort hiking boots were refurbished and shipped to me, however I cannot comment on quality of workmanship as my boots were lost in transit. Nushoe gets a 5 star rating for customer service. Without asking the customer service told me that they would replace boots and the new boots arrived shortly afterward. I am disappointed that my boots were lost in transit because after 8 years wear they were broken in to perfection.<//Text>< name>

<Review>I LOVE my boots. However, maybe I didn't love them the way I should. Just when I thought I was going to painfully find a new pair I ran across Nushoe. I was skeptical at first, but dived in and WOW!!! New soles, New inserts and MY BOOTS! It doesn't get any better than this. No breaking in, no pain, just MY BOOTS with another few years of life. You better believe I will send them back to Nushoe in a few years. Clearly better than a new pair.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d9464af26784b9:0xccafc0ff735fc1b8<//Gmap_id></record>

I've had three pair of Thorogood work boots, 2 different styles, repaired/refurbished by Nushoe. In every case they have been returned in excellent condition. I was really impressed by the expert craftsmanship. It was hard to believe they were the same boots on the first go around. I highly recommend Nushoe for anyone with a favorite pair of quality footwear. One of my favorite benefits of having footwear renewed is you skip the "break in" period; the leather is already soft asks molded for you! Love you guys & I'll be back, thank you.<//review>

I am totally amazed at how simple it was to send my shoes in to be repaired and how wonderful they looked when they came back!!!!  They are like totally new shoes, BUT the years of work that it took to mold the Birkenstocks to my feet remained intact!!!!  I am soooo glad the Birkenstock shoe store had the information to use Nushoe for repairs in the store!  Thank you for a great job done!< /Text>

Although turnaround via mail seems long, the end result is a pair of refurbished shoes that are "as good as new." I have had very few shoes in my 74 yard that are as comfortable as these slip-ons. It's worth rehabilitating them every couple of years!< /review>

<Review>I had a great experience with Nushoe, Inc. Through a recommendation from Birkenstock USA, I had my Birkenstock soles replaced. Nushoe, Inc., met my expectations and then some. There was some communication back and forth for additional questions once they received my shoes, they were awesome to deal with. I am very pleased and will use them again in the future for my Birkenstock repairs.< /Review>< pictures>

I sent a pair of my 8" Thorogood moc toe waterproof boots to NuShoe through Thorogoods own program and wasnt pleased at all. When I recieved my boots back, almost all of the welt was sanded off in a couple of spots, and the color of "polish" was off and didn't accomplish whatever it was trying to accomplish. They look horrible, and I have only worn them once since.</Text>

I was disappointed to wear out the sole so quickly. More disappointing was the company to replace my soles was located across country in California. I sent my shoes and upon their receipt of my shoes, it took over a month before I received them back. Only to see my shoe laces were in contrasting color and not the same color of the shoes, as purchased.  I do like my shoes and the work that was done to them. But for the price, I'm not sure the long wait for repairs and the contrasting laces are worth the trouble.  I would request black laces to match my shoes please.<//Text>< Rating>

<text>Excellent service! My expensive Thorogoods were in dire need of new treads. I hated the thought of throwing away perfectly good uppers. So I searched online and found Nushoe. What a gem indeed. For a fraction of the cost for a new pair I could re-sole my already broke- in leather boots. I couldn't be more delighted. Thanks Nushoe.<//text><name>Jonathan Kimble</name></record>

No only did they take over 4 months to resole my boots. They destroyed a $350 pair of boots with poor quality craftsmanship. They cut Into the gortex and leather rendering the boots no longer water proof and just glued their cut closed the repair and soles began to fail after 2 weeks I don't recommend anyone send quality boots to them.</text>

<Text>I highly recommend Nushoe, Inc. I sent two of my favorite pairs of Mayari Birkenstocks to Nushoe to have them resoled, cleaned, and refreshed. They came back in a timely manner looking as good as when I originally purchased them. Nushoe's prices are a great deal for the amount of work they put into my Birkenstocks.

HS Trask Chukka Boots.  I tossed them into the supplied bag and shipped them off. Easy.  Months later they came back. Looked great. New vibram soles.  I'm a pharmacist so I don't work in the weather.  Before long the adhesive begins to let go and the sole begins to separate. The part of the shoe the sole attaches to (midsole?) is now pulling away from the boot (leather upper?) so water gets to my toes. The stitching is coming apart.

I believe Nushoe delivered like they said they would.  My issue is with the short time frame from when I got the shoes back to when they started coming apart again.  Is it their fault?  I don't know.  I'm almost 60 and not some teenager who is rough on their footware but I believe they should have lasted longer than they did.<//Text>

Nushoe resoled and refurbished two pairs shoes for me, an Ecco Seattle Bike Toe Lace-Up and an Ecco Turn GTX Chukka Boot. Both are quality shoes that saw a lot of use the first time around. I am delighted with the results, and they were worth the wait. A more sustainable approach to shoe ownership! I will definitely be going back to Nushoe in the future.< /Text>

Many years ago when I purchased sandals the end of a season, I left them in the box with the intent to wear them in the future.  When I did take them out quite a while later, the soles had peeled away.  I had never had this happen before.  So, I took them to a shoemaker who made a mess with the glue--glue leaked out all over.  I thought I would have to garbage the shoes.   I then contacted Nushoe.  I was surprised when they agreed to repair them.  They sent me prepaid mailing instructions,  repaired the sandals, and returned them. There was no charge.   I look forward to wearing my "new" sandals this summer.  Nushoe went above and beyond.< /Review>

High quality work at a fair price.  Nushoe resoled two pair of my favorite cowboy boots and restored them to like-new condition.  I am a stickler for details and Nushoe exceeded my expectations.  I recommend Nushoe and appreciate their commitment to provide high quality work at a fair price.< /Text>

<text>I needed a resole, upper reconditioning and restiching of a leather loop that held a D-shaped lace tensioner in place.  I was happy the restitching was included in the "basic" package price.  The job took a couple weeks and things looked fine.  Unfortunately the restich tore out the second time I wore the shoes.  Actually, the leather edge at the site tore out.  It's too short to attempt anything again, so it's out of the shoelace path again.  The soles and uppers are fine, so thanks for the work, NuShoe.</text></record>

<Review>Sent my Ariat work boots to get resoled, and it was worth it. The new sole was original Ariat and they even but new insoles of Ariat brand. I have a new pair of work boots for the next couple of years and it only cost half of the cost of a new pair. I highly recommend, using NuShoe to do your shoe repairs. The quality is exceptional and the customer service is above anyone else.</Review>< GmapID>

This is my 4rd or 5th time using NuShoe. I have always been pleased with the turnaround and quality of work. Shoes always come back in better shape extending the life of the shoe. I have always purchased shoes that can be re-soled because I know NuShoe will fix them and I can keep wearing them for years.</Text>

<Text>I had a pair of Finn Sandals that I was considering replacing with a new pair. But the cost of a new pair was more than I wanted to spend. I looked online and found NuShoe. For about one third of the cost of a new pair of sandals my sandals were refurbished and looked new after NuShoe returned them to me.< /Text>< Pics>

I used Nushoe only because Ariat recommended them, and told me that they would be able to replace the original Dualpro soles. Guess what, they didn't. These boots are made of alligator skin,and I wanted the best they had, but my only option was the western sole. I sent them out in the provided packaging they sent me, with a check for the cost of the service. A few weeks later I got a call asking for payment. Apparently they lost the check. So I sent them another. About a month later they showed up.
I work in western wear retail, so I'm in a pair of cowboy boots every day. The quality of the repair was excellent, but they lost a star for loosing my check and not replacing the outsole with the original style.</text>

I sent in a pair of Ariat boots with worn out crepe soles and heels. Nushoe replaced the soles with factory replacement soles, polished them up, and returned a pair of boots that looked like new. This is the second time they replaced them on this particular pair of boots, extending the life of them significantly. Great job!</Text>

<review>Nushoe takes my Finn sandals made in Germany that I need for my orthotics and totally repairs them, new rocker soles, replacing any straps, stitching, etc. treats and cleans the leather and sends them back to me looking almost brand new for about 1/4th the cost of new ones.

I was part of a Western Wear family owned business for 20 years, before it's demise, and we refered our Ariat & Thorogood customers to Nushoe, with all positive feedback. 2 years after the stores closed I finally got around to corralling my worn & some originally defective boots, and sent them to Nushoe. ALL manners of the experience were top notch GREAT!, from the first tentative phone call to the finished product and delivery. Polite, patient, proficient, professional and amiable too. I reccomend Nushoe to anyone whose non-leather soled "favorites" are in need of TLC/ repair. Karl C. Baake< /text>

Have been a customer of NuShoe for many years. Quality of shoe "renewals" has been outstanding - shoes feel like they are brand new. NuShoe put extra effort into the small details - nice shine, new stitching where needed, new laces, etc. I will continue to be a customer,! Thank you, NuShoe!<//review>

I have had my Ariat boots recrafted at Nushoe for the last 10 years. I have been more than pleased with the quality of their work. I would highly recommend Nushoe for any shoe or boot repair.<//text>

They refurbished an old beat down pair of Thorogoods for less than 1/2 the cost of a new pair.
I literally have had multiple compliments from unknowing people that my leather is actually 4+ years  old.
Thank You Nushoe<//review>

<Text>Excellent tall boot repair. I have sent several pairs of Ariat English Field boots to NuShoe after the Ariat factory zippers broke. They replaced the zipper and polished the boots. They also replaced the footbed insert. They look brand new! Highly recommend!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I wear ECCO Shoes exclusively & have for over 20 years because they are right for my feet.  I have a favorite pair of casual lace and the soles had worn thin but the uppers were still perfect.  I started a search to see if they could be re-soled & found Nu-Shoe.  Made a call, received the shipping info and forwarded the ECCO's.  Timeline, tracking & status of the repair were just as described.  I spoke with several reps during the process who were professional, knowledgeable & answered my questions.  While the Vibram (resoles) are different from the original ECCO, the Vibram will be longer lasting.  I will be sending in several other pair for the same repair.  I am very pleased with Nu-Shoe, their personnel and the repair service which they offer.<//Review><GmapID>0x80d9464af26784b9:0xccafc0ff735fc1b8<//GmapID>< Response>

I had three year old Ariat boots completely re-done by Nushoe.  The boots came back brand new, perhaps even better than before with all new OEM outer sole.  The shipping was quick/easy and boxes perfectly sized.  Very happy with Nushoe's work!<//Review>

I had a pair of Chippewa 6 inch work boots that I had owned for 20 years. They were used and abused but were my most comfortable boots. There was so little sole left so I thought I'd try Nushoe. They resoled them with vibram mini lug 430 soles and the job done was top notch. A couple of issues though.  For some reason, my boots have become incredibly uncomfortable and don't feel like the same boots. Maybe they need a break in period all over again. Maybe it is the Nushoe insole they put in. Another issue is the leather reconditioning. Originally the leather had a nice matte finish. When I got mine back, the leather had a high sheen. I'm not sure if this is typical or what. Before I pass final judgement, I will be putting these shoes to work again. After a month or so I hope they become my old favorites again. If they stay this uncomfortable, I will be sad I spent the money with Nushoe.< /review>

< Review>
I had a full restoration done on 2 pairs of Thorogood work boots. The foot bed padding is suppose to be replaced in a full restoration it wasn’t on either pair. Any bad stitching is suppose to be fixed there are spots on each pair of boots that the stitching wasn’t fixed when it clearly needs it and the stitching on the leather they did fix is poorly done. The sole stitching is so close to the edge you can see it in the sole. All together nothing done on these boots shows any sign that Nushoe is a quality boot restoration business. I will not be using there services again and I recommend that you never even try them out. I sent an e mail with pics and haven’t even been contacted by anyone. Poor service in all areas of this business.<//Review>

They ruined a $750 pair of mine by trimming too close to the stitching around the sole, leaving them no longer water resistant and changing the shape of the shoe. They also replaced the leather inner heel pad with a ridiculously cheap one which provides no support at all and is catered and uncomfortable to walk on now. I reached out to customer service three times with no response at all. If you love your shoes don’t use Nushoe.< /text>< Response>

We can confirm that Nushoe does all of those.  We have referred Nushoe to several friends that inquired about our experience many whom utilized their services  and communicated how impressed and happy they were with their experience.

< Review>
I’m impressed!
I have been buying 2 pairs of boots a year for quite some Time .((Heavy construction lots of hours very hard on my boots  cutting grinding etc))
I decided I would buy a new pair of the same boot and start having my boots repaired instead of constantly replacing them . September 23 I printed my label
October 16 they are back
They look great and the craftsmanship is great .
I will be doing this for as long as I can using 2 pairs of boots so I’m not in here complaining about how long it takes to get them back .  I did a total restore on my thorogood 8 inch work boots it was 125 plus tax and shipping . I believe they were in the 250 range when I bought them that’s 500 dollars a year in boots and now I won’t have to keep buying new boots ! So glad I got this service done ! Thank you<//Review>

<Review>Mephistos sandals **********

Sent in my 25 year old sandals for an overhaul and  the results are spectacular.  These old sandals have never been more comfortable!!  I didn't know this was possible but since a pair of new ones would cost $300 had to give it a try.   Truly amazing - I give them ten stars.< /Review><GmapID>0x80d9464af26784b9:0xccafc0ff735fc1b8</GmapID><Response>{'time': 1615342363732, 'text': "Hi Rick, Wow, we were blown away by your positive words, we really appreciate your review!

< Review>
I've used them twice, and will never use them again.  It's not worth the time and money to use them.  I will just buy new boots, if they are the only option for resoling.

I've sent the same pair of Ariat boots to them twice.  It's taken over 2 months to get them back each time.  And the first time, they didn't sew the heal liners back in.  I took it to a local cobbler to have that done, as I didn't have months to wait for them to do it.

Their customer service is also horrible.  No interest in being helpful to you what so ever.  I found out the soles needed for my boots was on back order, only after multiple weeks of being told my boots would be done at the end of the week.  Each time offering no apology or caring they were keeping my riding boots half of the season.  On top of that, they still didn't ship out when they said they would, and took more time than they said they would to arrive.

If there was a 0 star option, I would have used it.</Review>

<text>Still disappointed with these folks
.
Not satisfied due to returned boots stating leather was to out of shape. I have been using nushoe for about 6 years and I was surprised to open the package and see my same boots not resoled. So I found this union shoe repair shop called: Tulsa Shoe Rebuilders. They are union so this works out for me being I'm a union member out of local 1607. This shop understands how much I love my boots.<//text><gmapID>0x80d9464af26784b9:0xccafc0ff735fc1b8< /gmapID>< userid>

< Review>
Have had them rebuild 3 different pairs of Mephisto shoes, and it has been terrific each time.  Not super fast, but always top notch. I'll take good over fast.
Make sure the shoes you send are:
1) worth rebuilding. Is it cheaper to just buy new?
2) built so that they can be rebuilt.  Many shoes and boots are just glued together and really not designed to re-build .

High quality shoes totally worth the time and the money to rebuild.<//Review>

"I want to thank you for your wonderful, quality service. I posted this on Facebook and let everyone know that I got exactly what was described on your website: quality workmanship, clean and polished boots, and email confirmations, all in a timely and affordable manner. It seems like quality work and great customer service are hard to find these days, so it was nice to be able to share a positive post about your company, nushoe. Thank you, Olga, and thank you, NuShoe!" –Karenan S.< /Text>

<text>I would give them no stars if I could.

I shipped off a pair of Ariats for warranty repair in early May. They were received by NuShoe on 5/8/18. I was told it was a 3-4 week turn around on the repair and getting them back. They were "QC & Package" on 6/8, exactly a month later. I then called on 6/13 to ask why they hadn't shipped since they were packaged on the Friday previous at 12:53 PM and asked about expedited shipping on them since they took longer than expected, and was told that it was not possible, and they were shipping that afternoon. I then kept checking the status to see when they had shipped, and they did not leave the NuShoe facility until Friday 6/15. I am not scheduled to receive them until 6/20.

If I had been paying for this repair, I would be levit with this company and demanding a refund. Not to mention the Ariats were only 3 months old when the soles started to get a hole in them. If these "new" soles last less than a year, they will receive a phone call from me, because I can take my boots to a local shop and have new soles put on in no less than 2 days, and pay $80 and have soles that last for 12-18 months, (I wear my boots almost daily).

I do not recommend this company for any type of repair.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>It took forever for them to get my shoes back to me and the very first time I wore them the stitching busted open.  What a sham.  The new soles feel terrible also.<//text>< user>

I've been using Nushoe for over 15 years.  I used to buy only H.S. Trask men's shoes and NuShoe was Trask's "resoler of choice," which is how I got started using NuShoe.  I've had at least 10 pairs of shoes resoled from Trask, Neil M. and Allen Edmonds.  Every time the results have been amazing.  Basically, I pay the $80 and back comes a virtually new pair of favourite shoes.  They do take their time, generally 30 days or so, but you know that going in.  I can't figure out how so many people on here have had such a bad experience.  I'm totally satisfied.</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>They ruined my shoes, charged me a lot of money, and persist in being rude about it. I'm exhausted. I have dealt with probably a half dozen customer service people over the past few months. I have sent them pictures of what the shoes originally looked like, what the new ones for sale still look like, and the difference between tan and gray, but their best offer is to keep my money and re-return my ruined shoes back to me.

Mephisto needs to find a different authorized refurbishment place. I loved my Mephistos so much! But this experience has been a nightmare.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80d9464af26784b9:0xccafc0ff735fc1b8<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Abysmal customer service. Despite 3 attempts to get them to tell me how to get an extra pair of laces, they never responded. When I called them, my estimated wait time kept increasing, from 3 minutes all the way to 15 minutes, over the course of about 15 minutes of holding. My shoes took 5 weeks to return and the job is so-so. The color looks artificial and the laces (!) they supplied were the wrong color (gold going in, black coming out). I didn't give them 1 star because the footbed and sole actually look nice. Avoid if possible.<//Review>

< review>
I would rate them at zero stars if possible.  They claim they can repair ECCO, but the fact is they can not.  I sent two pairs of ECCOs to them one with the polyurethane sole and the other was a rubber sole.  I had taken the time to carefully package the pair of shoes separately, as the polyurethane soles had begun to disintegrate and had a sticky residue.  After following their online instructions, I received a box from them a few weeks later with both pairs of shoes mashed together, and the residue on both pairs of shoes. No email, no phone call, nothing just both pairs of $200(+) shoes crammed into a box that was too small for them, and a note shove deep into one of the shoes (it took two weeks to notice there was a note because it was shoved into the toebox of one of the shoes). Completely unprofessional, and looking into how to hold them responsible for making my shoes worse by getting this residue on the inside and out side of the shoes!</review>

My local cobbler took one look at my shoes' construction and just shook his head, so I decided I had nothing to lose in spite of all these poor reviews. Promised turnaround is 2-4 weeks; mine were delivered to them by UPS on February 23 and left their facility on March 29, the day after I emailed asking about an ETA. Total time away from me: six and a half weeks. Ding! That's one star off.

On the bright side, they came back exactly as I'd hoped. New laces that look better than the originals, and precisely the sole I'd requested (using the Vibram Sole Factor program). I paid $50 for the shoes and $75 for the resole service -- my feet are size 14AA, there are like six shoes on the planet that fit, so to me it was well worthwhile. NuShoe made it work. I'm grateful.<//text>

I sent a pair of AGL Cap-Toe Ballet flats in for refurbishment because the soles were worn. The tops still looked good, but because I wanted them to look their best I opted for the "Ladies Ultra" service. What a huge mistake! The soles are now fine, but the tops came back looking terrible -- strangely dull and monotone! NuShoe's "ultra" service seems to consist of spraying the entire shoe black, including the patent-leather toe, patent silver-metallic strap, and the silver metal rings and buckle. It took me more than an hour (using rubbing alcohol, q-tips, and a microfiber cloth) to carefully remove the black spray from the metal and patent-leather parts. Fortunately, I was largely able to restore the metal and patent-leather parts to their former color and shine. What a disappointment and a waste of $80.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>About a year ago, during the pandemic, I sent my husband's black wingtips to Nushoe for new soles and heels and an overall refurbishment of the leather uppers, which were very scuffed and scratched. He has had these shoes for probably 30 years, and they were in bad shape. When the repaired shoes arrived, I was amazed because they looked like a brand new pair. The new soles and heels look quite durable, and the shine on the uppers is blinding.

I highly recommend Nushoes. The cost is a little high, but the improvement to my husband's shoes probably means he will not need to buy another pair of dress shoes for the remainder of his life. Customer service was also very helpful when I called for advice on which option to choose before I placed my order and mailed the shoes. The process for shipment between the customer and Nushoes is very convenient, too.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Great job on my boots!.  Repair was timely and results were awesome.  I prefer rebuilt boots as opposed to have to break in new ones.  Will definitely use them again when I  wear these new soles out!</Review>

It was pretty empty today when I was there. It's normally alive but today it seemed like a ghost town. Everyone I did see seems to still be wearing masks. The food court was open and you are able to sit at the tables and eat your food. Everything seemed pretty clean they had people cleaning. Besides being a little empty it was a pleasure and very peaceful I must say. Stay safe, and stay blessed everyone.</text>

<Review>Clean and beautiful indoor mall. I grew up going to the South Bay Galleria, and the awe inspiring three tier open center gallery is something to see. Please see the glass roof reminiscent of modern European architecture. Stunning during a bright day.< /Review><date>1616284999527< /date><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlcfE0QVQ90GE_iYdqe18715s-uYgMk06_NvPx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpuBfCImv5LLH0MLM-GsRoJVO6H3F1L4HRNMn_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFK0pBA5Nwmw3tc68Pk2gpbO_mfALeqzta_5xV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><user>101536754803807777439</user>< name>

It's a fabulous mall,  looks beautiful with many inexpensive shops and restaurants to choose from.  Free parking is one of its best features< /Review>

My go to spot for new kicks. Mall is pretty small and even tho a lot of stores closed down I still love coming here for kicks perfumes and clothes. I live 5 mins away so its convenient. Its not the  most fancy luxurious mall but, I always find great stuff.<//text>

This place is more of a four-star mall. I just wanna balance out the low reviews that aren't earned.
This is a nice, clean mall. Never too busy and a great local place to see a movie or grab a bite. Although a lot of the spaces are closed which is disapointing.
Good VR, and there aren't a lot of hangers around which I love!<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Not many people at the mall so it was nice to walk around and easy to find a parking spot.  Was a bit disappointed because the shoe store I expected to shop at was no longer in the mall. Not many big department stores ro choose from so I picked up a few items at Macy's and called it a day.</Review>< gmap_id>

Good mall, open with plenty of signs reminding everyone about social distancing. Shops are enforcing it by capping how many are allowed into a store at once as of reopening in CA this spring.<//Text>

Considering the shopping guidelines it was very pleasant shopping at the S.B. Galleria. Lots of cars but really not that crowed & plenty of product to sift through.  All safety guidelines were being followed so felt very comfortable shopping.<//text>

Really nice small plenty of room to social distance. They placed arrows helping people to properly social distance and controlling the flow of the pedestrians in the mall. Really clean and a good amount of security on site.</Text>

Southbay galleria is still great but because of the pandemic stores inside are mostly closed some are on clearance sale, but some restaurants in the building premises are open and they're accepting dine-in, social distancing and face masks observed.< /Review>

One of the best malls!

They also have circus in the parking lot.  Almost all the national stores are here.  Clean mall.<//Review>

Great, standard mall. I go often for the AMC Theater, which has the “we bring it to you” option. The movie theater is on the third floor, so you have to navigate the parking garage. There’s a great food court here, with a unique mango-based restaurant. Many stores seem to still be open, despite the national trend. Outside the mall is Sprouts, which can’t be beat.</Review>

I go often for the AMC Theater, which has the “we bring it to you” option. The movie theater is on the third floor, so you have to navigate the parking garage. There’s a great food court here, with a unique mango-based restaurant. Many stores seem to still be open, despite the national trend. Outside the mall is Sprouts, which can’t be beat.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Date>1565670964065<//Date><Text>The one star is not about the South Bay Galleria. I always enjoy my time there.  I am giving the one star to a valet service called Cronus Valet Parking services because the man, and I use that term loosely, who was giving the tickets to the customers for the valet parking, represented their company poorly.  Usually an entire area is roped off or space markers are placed in the parking spots set aside for valet use. I parked in a space thst had no designation that it wss a valet space. As my party and I walked toward the restaurant, the vexatious valet approached me to give me a pink valet ticket to park in the parking spot I had chosen. I told him that the space I chose was not a designated valet spot as it was neithet roped off not had the parking marker reserving the space. He waved my comment off, and as I have parked in the same area many times before, I reminded him that legally, there is supposed to be markers for all the valet spots, he mimicked me quoting the legalities, and then made a comment of  the caliber that he only has this problem with" you people", and tried to charge me for parki.g my own car. As I don't resort to shouting or physical activity when I am being mocked and insulted,  I did take a pucture of him and the name of his company.  He put his hand up to block the picture as he knew he had verbally stepped over the line, but I managed to get two anyway which I will post to this site. I don't know if the "you people" referred to my ethnicity or my being a woman, but either way I was uncomfortable be addressed in such a manner. I moved my car to another 2 thousand feet away and had to walk a good distance to the restaurant. This Cronus Valet company needs to speak to their employee regarding his manner in dealing with people. He needs at least 200 hours of customer service, cultural and ethnicity sensitivity training before being allowed to deal with people, and a thousand hours of volunteering to work with the needy among the group he was disparaging. If this canmot be done, then Cronus needs to lose the contract wit the South Bay Galleria and the valet needs to lose his job.  Because he was disparaging of the law, and tried to charge me for a service he did not perform  he doesn't seem to have much respect for legalities, and that makes me wonder what other legalities does he circumvent.<//Text>< UserId.>

This is a ghost of a mall. Even before Covid 19 it was scheduled for renovation and repurposing. The food court is closed. Kohls and Macy's are open along with Q. Express is having a going out of business sale. There are two restaurants open on the first floor. There is a lot of empty space that could be put to use.<//Review>

I sure love the South Bay Galleria.. Unfortunately it is completely shut down as of lately because of the pandemic that's happening at the moment.. so, I guess that means no more impulsive spending sprees!!.. Well time to save some money!! Yay! (well see)< /Text>

All was quiet today despite the Christmas rush. A strong measure of this is the lack of lines at McDonalds. Happy shopping plenty of parking.<//Review>

<text>South Bay Galleria is a great place to spend with friends. It has a movie theater, VR, and so much more! There are multiple places to shop for clothes and even stores to get some school supplies if needed. Although when it comes to the food court I wish it had more known food places than just Panda Express and Wetzel Pretzel. Even so, it's still an overall great place to hang back and just relax. 👍</text>< pictures>

This is a mall that’s past its prime. Seems to have really inexpensive stores that cater to teens with cheap clothing, candy and the like. On the plus side, they do have an AMC theater for those of us who belong to AMC’s Stubs A-list.  Also, it’s really easy to park. However, if you are like me and want higher quality items, this is probably not the right mall for you.<//text>

Love the new attractions. But at $18. Per child at Dinosaur land we probably won't frequent they're to much. There's never a Special or discount. The Park looks fun and it was nice to see that they offered a shop and Drop special. This is always nice.< /Text>

The one star is not about the South Bay Galleria. I always enjoy my time there.  I am giving the one star to a valet service called Cronus Valet Parking services because the man, and I use that term loosely, who was giving the tickets to the customers for the valet parking, represented their company poorly.  Usually an entire area is roped off or space markers are placed in the parking spots set aside for valet use. I parked in a space thst had no designation that it wss a valet space. As my party and I walked toward the restaurant, the vexatious valet approached me to give me a pink valet ticket to park in the parking spot I had chosen. I told him that the space I chose was not a designated valet spot as it was neithet roped off not had the parking marker reserving the space. He waved my comment off, and as I have parked in the same area many times before, I reminded him that legally, there is supposed to be markers for all the valet spots, he mimicked me quoting the legalities, and then made a comment of  the caliber that he only has this problem with" you people", and tried to charge me for parki.g my own car. As I don't resort to shouting or physical activity when I am being mocked and insulted,  I did take a pucture of him and the name of his company.  He put his hand up to block the picture as he knew he had verbally stepped over the line, but I managed to get two anyway which I will post to this site. I don't know if the "you people" referred to my ethnicity or my being a woman, but either way I was uncomfortable be addressed in such a manner. I moved my car to another 2 thousand feet away and had to walk a good distance to the restaurant. This Cronus Valet company needs to speak to their employee regarding his manner in dealing with people. He needs at least 200 hours of customer service, cultural and ethnicity sensitivity training before being allowed to deal with people, and a thousand hours of volunteering to work with the needy among the group he was disparaging. If this canmot be done, then Cronus needs to lose the contract wit the South Bay Galleria and the valet needs to lose his job.  Because he was disparaging of the law, and tried to charge me for a service he did not perform  he doesn't seem to have much respect for legalities, and that makes me wonder what other legalities does he circumvent.<//text>

The massage ladies need to stop grabbing people by the arm and pulling them over to them. Need more control over the restaurants and their cleanliness. Great variety of stores and lots of parking.<//review>

My favorite Movie place! Always clean and customer service is great. Many snack options, food can be a little overpriced, but its really tasty. They also have a small bar for adults only on one side of the Movie theater.
Many shops and many offers.  Lots of free parking as well.<//Review>

<Text>BACKGROUND: The location is a Covid-19 testing site. It is specifically located in one of large parking garages off an almost empty parking lot.  ANALYSIS:  Not enough detailed binformation was provided by the LA County.  And your GPS may not be sophisticated enough to find a specific location in  large shopping  center.<//Text><rating>1</rating>< Pics>

What a shame people no longer step outside to shop. This location is great being by the coast with huge parking structure but sadly by the looks of the lonely independent retail stores, it'll be closed soon. Hopefully they remodel and bring us some great updates to the community. Would like to see more eateries besides Cali Pizza Kitchen and Red Robin.<//text>

I'm stunned... A mall whose businesses seem to operate as if guest enjoyment came before doing every single thing for profit. Let me explain: A) the movie theater is dine-in with cushy seats, allows self serve drinks and icees, and sells hot Cheetos popcorn... enough said. B ) multiple food court spots allow self serve! C) 2 VR stations with an amazing game selection!  And did I mention it's a 3 floor, hyper-modern American mall with something for everyone? Go to this place. You'll feel like you were back in high school only you were one of the cool kids who went to the mall all the time< /Text>

Once a nicer and hipper place, South Bay Galleria seems to have adapted as a lively more affordable mall. Not in the main mall structure itself, but on the perimeter there's plenty of other good shops to go to as well, so hopefully this place will remain around for a while.</review>

Was a really cool mall back in the 80's when it opened, had nice fountains and was a local hang out for seniors and other Redondo and Torrance residents. Later all the fountains were removed and they rolled in those annoying kiosk's and slowly we stopped seeing the locals there. Went to Red Robin for a while but now we just don't feel safe there so we avoid it. It's rumored they're thinking of building low income housing there. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse. It may share the same fate as the Hawthorne Mall.<//text>

This has become my favorite AMC, l just joined the insider's A list. I use to go to the Rolling Hills one but Their staff including the Manager were so Not helpful or compassionate! Where South Bay Galleria was just the opposite and several stayed with me until my issues were resolved better than I had hoped for twice!</Text>

If the mall itself opens at a 11am then all the shops should open at the same time with the exception of the Movie Theater. I came here at 10am cause on Maps it said one of the shops I came here to visit opens at 10am. And its not! And I notice some of the stores are open and the rest are closed...this is super tacky! Now I know why I don't come here. Lack of company direction and time management. SMDH</Text>

Nice shops, plenty of restaurants, plenty of parking, nice movie theater, and a beautiful water fountain. I also enjoyed their Farmers market!

The fourth floor has a jumping area for kids. It pretty cool, it's all about dinosaurs.<//Review><user_name>Lisseth T.</user_name><Rating>5</Rating>< UserId.>

<Rating>5<//Rating><pictures>None</pictures><Review>One of the best malls out there. Its chill the glass elevators are very chill to go to. The glass roof is very cool too. Even though there isn't any stores like target inside there,  the target right outside of it makes up for it. There is a theatre, videogame stores, cloth stores, vr places, and more. Really love this mall< /Review></record>

The food court does not have too many good restaurant options. The mall is pretty clean and it is in a safe area! There is really nothing special about it though.< /review>< pics>

A lot of changes from when I used to shop there on a regular basis. Stopped shopping there because some stores were closing. Was I amazed when I saw the Mall n the surrounding restaurants n stores. Will make it a regular shopping place. Highly recommend< /review>

I think that the mall closes early, and not all stores are open, its a good place to just walk around and to see the stores that are open.< /text>

Although I suppose it's my fault, but as a first-time moviegoer I was disappointed to walk out of the movies at 930pm only go discover I would have to walk around the entire outside perimeter of the mall to get back to my car. So, if catching a later flick might I suggest parking in the parking garage?< /Text>

<text>This mall seems a little outdated some big stores have closed their doors for good. But I would say the best part it's the movie theater, they have renovated it in order to compete with newer fancier theaters. There's some good restaurants too. I grew up in this area and would hate to see this place disappear.<//text>< name>

Although I suppose it's my fault, but as a first-time moviegoer I was disappointed to walk out of the movies at 930pm only go discover I would have to walk around the entire outside perimeter of the mall to get back to my car. So, if catching a later flick might I suggest parking in the parking garage?<//text>

Lots of diversity in shops as well as good prices. The food is delicious and fairly priced. I hang out at the mall with my friends a lot and we always have a good time. The only thing is that the security is rude and stop me for wearing a hat or hoodie< /text>

<Text>Some of the shops seem to be the same one with different names. It's big but not to big. They have a dinosaur museum and activity place, a train ride on the second floor with a very passionate conductor. A movie theater to go to after you are done shopping and some really delicious desserts here. Would definitely recommend coming here to waste time.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>This cinema has really improved in many areas: reclining seats, food is delivered to you, better looking interior, as well as some others! Overall, a good place to watch a movie.</Review>< Pics>

Just a boring mall look outdated.
Needs some freshing up and it has a chance to attract more people.
Also the store verity used to be much better than it is now.</Review>

Went 2 c the Avengers Movie at AMC theater. They had only bottom seats, right up on the screen. Looks like I'll be waiting until the movie comes 2 video. Then I can rent it for a buck seventy-five rather than nearly $15.
That movie has really kicked butt. I can't wait 2 c what is coming next.
Otherwise, I don't shop the Mall. Too expensive for me.< /Text>

It's OK, not what used to be. People who work and shop there are predominantly Hispanics because the rest of the people busy working and paying taxes, so those people will raise their hoarders of kids☹️😞👿 Years ago it was nice and largest mall in So Cali.< /text>

Nothing like some action with Dwayne "The Rock Johnson Alongside Jason Statham.
The mall is a great place to shop hang out and beat the heat. Lots of places to sit down and enjoy a meal. Has a great food court with lots of choices. Don't forget Halloween is coming Spencer's for all your oddities!

<review>Great place for shopping, eating, watching movies or just hanging out. Plenty of stores that are within nice walking distance of each other. Doesn't take long to go from one store to another that could be at the opposite end. Food options are varied and lots of little stands across the mall add to that. Plenty of great parking and easy access to stores across as well.<//review><Date>1458805823424<//Date><resp>None</resp>< rating>

Another one is being planned to return the mall to an outdoor one with the addition of condos and apartments.  It is good to see the Mall change with the times.  Still a fun place to catch a movie or grab a bite in the bright foodcourt.  My favorite is the Mongolian BBQ.</Review>< Pictures>

It has been upgraded a lot. It has many of my fave stores to shop with and for my family. Another perk are the activities for the kids of all ages. Great for a date night a movie and Red Robin it's always a yes.< /Review>

Yes Total Wines is a place to go always give good deals always a good experience. Nice atmosphere for window shopping and just relax and watch people shop. You can pick your favorite flavor pop, dip in sauce, and sprinkle some toppings.< /Text>

<name>Brandon Liu<//name><Text>Great place for shopping, eating, watching movies or just hanging out. Plenty of stores that are within nice walking distance of each other. Doesn't take long to go from one store to another that could be at the opposite end. Food options are varied and lots of little stands across the mall add to that. Plenty of great parking and easy access to stores across as well.<//Text><user_id>106108402969077435983< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

This mall seems to give off the impression that it is in a poor area. Most places here do not accept credit/debit without providing ID which is technically correct and should always be done, however this gives an impression that there is a lot of people with stolen credit cards coming here for small purchases. (Checking ID for buying a pretzel). While the staff on most of the shops are nice it is just one of my least favorite malls in los angeles. It does have a movie theater in it as well as various clothing and food stores. The center of the mall constantly seems to be under construction for fun new additions/events that happen in this place.</Text>

Used to be a good mall. The only highlights are kohl’s and the AMC with reclining seats. I suggest going to del amo mall if you are looking for a more exciting shopping experience.< /Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>The best thing about this mall is Red Robin the staff are very friendly and fast. I got my food hot and very tasty. The movie theater is fine nothing wrong with it but it doesn't stand out. The Mall in Cerritos to name one has better shipping. If you don't wanna do any shipping then definitely go to the movie theater here. And try eating at Red Robin.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2b4f97a0167a3:0xe4e4b4b9a5ecd026< /GmapID></record>

By far the emptiest mall I've been to. Walked into several stores and we weren't even greeted. Selections were scarce. Did get great help at The Sunglass Hut. Walked into the tmobile and the girl was actually sitting down on her phone playing a game. Very, very nonchalant experience. If you're looking for a crowd less, unhelpful, laid back experience, this is your mall.< /review>

<Text>When this mall first opened it was very trendy and somewhat upscale. It has really gone downhill over the years! All of the boutique shops are gone and most of the mall consists of cheap novelty stores. The crowd that goes there has really changed as well. I don't feel safe there.< /Text>< Pictures>

Incredible location.  Across the street from Designer Shoe Warehouse where my wife loves to shop. I go across the street to the Galleria to stroll around and look at the windows in the mall<//Text>

<review>I was trying to fined shoes everywhere and then I called the vans store to see if the had the shoes I was looking for and then they said yes. Also the employees are really nice they put the shoe laces on my new shoes and that was very generous of him. Thank you Southbay galleria for everything!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I started going here 2017 never ever been before. A good work out 🚶 here and there everywhere. In the mall was so tired 👎 clothes on the floor enjoyed shopping there.
With my daughter have to go back to Victoria secret underwear and bra. Hey can you tell me do they have a 🎥 that i can see instead of me looking at 📺 at home sitting down< /Review>

Love this place. It has the best AMC Theater in the area with luxury recliners in the Dolby Theater. The mall is hardly ever packed. I would usually rather go here than delamo which is usually much busier.<//review>

<review>So much to do and look at. Everyplace is inspiring so artistic. But how they built the mall, Is so confusing there is no escalator that goes down from 3rd floor to 1st but there is 1 that goes up.

This place needs a serious revival. Lots of stores are leaving which is causing other stores to close. Security is so-so and when I was there today there was a fight on the first level. Food court is pretty good. People watching is great.</Review>

<Text>This mall sure has a lot of vacancies now! Many empty spots. Probably when Nordstrom left and went to Del Amo... It seems there's less people in the mall. Which in a way, is good if you don't like crowded and busy malls!😃 But besides the mall, you have other stores and restaurants outside that are great! So, it's a matter of choice.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp>< time>

<Text>Used to go here all the time as a kid and used to think of it as a magical place. However as I got older, I realized that magic might have came from me being a child and there being more stores here.
While I still visit this location, it has gone downhill since 2010-ish.
There's just an aura of sadness that permeates this place.
The mall has been stuck in a aesthetical rut for ages, looking more like a parody of malls from the 90's with each passing year.
I wish this place the best of luck, but I won't be suprised if it closed in the next few years if it's current owners don't change anything around this place.
If it could work for Del Amo, then who's to say it cant work for the Galleria?</Text>< pics>

I went to Wonder of Dinosaurs. It was absolutely amazing. The top floor had bouncers with obstacle courses, similar rock climbing (but in the bouncer) to go down the slide and dinosaurs in the bouncers. There may have been at least 6 to 9 nine different bouncers.(children only)They had a bouncer maze that the adults could go through with the kids. Multiple tables and chairs with crayons and activity paper on them for all ages. Digging in sand for dino bones. Mining in water for dino bones, 2 T-Rex's you could ride that move and take pictures of your child on. A baby stegosaurus your child could sit on too. Also bones and settings of Dinosaurs throughout the top floor. Take the elevator down one floor and they have the most awesome exhibit of Dinosaurs that make the actual sounds of the species. It has has signs with the facts about the type of Dino. This was truly amazing and I felt like I was back in the time of the dinosaurs. They lighting was wonderful and quite a few of them moved, appeared to be eating (the plant-eaters) and communicating with each other. They also had a small dinosaur train ride,a dinosaur egg ride and few other things to do on this floor. I would definitely go here again and recommend it to people. It's hard to believe it was inside a mall. It was more like a theme park!< /text>

So much to do and look at. Everyplace is inspiring so artistic. But how they built the mall, Is so confusing there is no escalator that goes down from 3rd floor to 1st but there is 1 that goes up. Just an awesome place to hang out.< /Review>

<text>It's an all right shopping center, it carries basic brands, though the Express store has a variety of styles, they used to have Nordstrom's and Bebe store but I couldn't find them last time I went. I don't shop much at Kohl's but that particular location has loads of great home department as well as men's shoes and some items that you won't find somewhere else. If you use Amazon return at their location you get a discount for one item or a purchase.
the location is in a good area almost in the middle of Torrance close to del amo so if you are out there the food cart has a variety of good food and very clean it's not very noisy, there aren't too many kids, it just close to Nordstrom's rack super Target and if you more department stores so it is worth being around the area and checking out their little boutiques. They have a Macy's with a good cosmetic department, it doesn't have too many employees but they have a nice Mac corner fragrances and Lancome the rest are smaller counters vs del amo. It's a good shopping center for people with kids or if you're looking to just speak up at fashion item. The kiosk in those places have some skin care cosmetics and print services for t-shirts. They have some VR game shop as well as a movie theater that is good to watch and go to if you're out there as well. Plenty of free parking</text><time>1558077414819< /time><response>None< /response><username>Cherine H</username>< Gmap_id>

I'm not a mall person, bit for the mall goers it is a great place . Plenty of stores that over charge for things, but that is the way of the mall. It was clean and lots of security.  I  liked the theater.  Those seats  and the popcorn was good. And if you like getting boozed up while watching a movie,  this is your place.<//text>

I love Galleria. It's lost some popularity due to the expansion of Del Amo and the loss of a few stores, but it's still my number one. Del Amo is great, but it's huge Mega Mall size is a bit overwhelming. The mall is clean and friendly and is a nice spot to shop with friends and family.<//Review>

I like this mall because of its size.  I'm not big on crowds.  It's just the right size.  I know where all my favorite stores are.  So I'm in and out. And CPK and Red Robin give you a quick food selection</review>

It's an all right shopping center, it carries basic brands, though the Express store has a variety of styles, they used to have Nordstrom's and Bebe store but I couldn't find them last time I went. I don't shop much at Kohl's but that particular location has loads of great home department as well as men's shoes and some items that you won't find somewhere else. If you use Amazon return at their location you get a discount for one item or a purchase.
the location is in a good area almost in the middle of Torrance close to del amo so if you are out there the food cart has a variety of good food and very clean it's not very noisy, there aren't too many kids, it just close to Nordstrom's rack super Target and if you more department stores so it is worth being around the area and checking out their little boutiques. They have a Macy's with a good cosmetic department, it doesn't have too many employees but they have a nice Mac corner fragrances and Lancome the rest are smaller counters vs del amo. It's a good shopping center for people with kids or if you're looking to just speak up at fashion item. The kiosk in those places have some skin care cosmetics and print services for t-shirts. They have some VR game shop as well as a movie theater that is good to watch and go to if you're out there as well. Plenty of free parking< /Text>

I have so many memories built up here over the years. In recent times, it's become kind of empty, partly due to the new Del Amo, I guess. Still worth it if only for the theater which is an AMC dine-in with the reclining chairs. Also nice if you want a less busy shopping experience.<//review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Worse Security Staff I’ve ever worked with . Most stores leave the mall because the rent is too high or it’s not enough customers entering the mall. Teenagers literally go there to fight or smoke weed Or have sexual intercourse. The Security Director Allowed his Supervisors to Harrass my wife (a former SBG Mall Security Officer) while she was on duty. The Assistant Director would literally follow her every time she was headed down to the basement to go on her lunch or 10 minute break because they all assumed we would meet up there to hang out. When my wife told the director that she felt as if she was being harassed by his assistant ; He told her it’s best we don’t use that word “Harrasment” . They never caught us together and they even tried to tell us we couldn’t be together as a couple but even my Branch Manager told us otherwise. I used to love this mall until I worked there lol . In reality there’s no stars ⭐️.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b4f97a0167a3:0xe4e4b4b9a5ecd026<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We were here at 4 am for a Bethany Mota Meet & Greet. Security had the bright idea to move the line around (away from the parking structure) at the end those of us that got here at 4 am ended up towards the end of the  line. Security's explanation was that a mistake was made but everyone would see here. Security needs to be better trained or not host these big events. It doesn't take a genius or a group of 10 to correctly move the lines.</Review>

<text>This mall has become something really nice! Three levels of popular and modern shops, a variety of food ranging from food court to great sit down restraunts. It even has a dine in movie theater at the top! I remember coming as a kid, and it being unplesant. Now I wouldn't mind spending a half a day here.<//text>< pictures>

Not worth it. Due to the renovation of Del Amo, this mall has been going downhill. Cheap circuses, famer's markets, and other small event's fill the parking lot. This mall no longer has an anchor, and is not worth coming too. Del Amo has way more stores and restaurants, and it's only a 10 minute drive away. Unless you're looking for a deal at a store in the Galleria, don't come here!<//Review>

Last Thursday my husband and I were driving down Hawthorne Boulevard and I needed to eat so and they had their farmer's market and they were closing down thank God there was still some taco stands up and we ate some tacos there was kind of pricey but the tacos are really big I don't know the name of the taco stands and I'm sorry I was too hungry to take the pictures first and I wish I did the tacos are really huge and they put in a lot of a lot of ranchera and it was very delicious so and their Farmers Market is Thursdays from 8 to 2 at that Galleria so if you happen to be by there on Thursday stop by and eat and have a good time< /Text>

<Review>Not as nice as Del Almo, however, there is a good selection of stores here and closer to home.

The mall is clean and parking isn't too much of an issue.  There is a decent foot court.< /Review>< gmapID>

Cheap movies in recliner chairs early in the day. This theater also has free parking which is extremely convient. For those who partake in expensive food, it is possible to order food and have it brought to your seat. However, I would recommend what I call the "wake and watch" wake up at 9 or 10 see a movie at 10:30 for $8 in a extremely comfortable seat.<//text>

As long as you park right in front with the valet is so then keep it on your car and you only go there in the mid-morning to late morning you should be fine and your car should be cool only problem with that places it's a little iffy after Dark.< /text>

I like heights and I like escalators, so for "ambiance" this place is a win, with three levels. The food court is decent enough. Let's compare it to the nearby Del Amo Fashion Center though. (a) here it's MUCH easier to walk quickly to the store you want to get to. If you're looking for some exercise speed-walking, then Del Amo will give you a workout. (b) The movie theater at Del Amo has more theaters, with better seating, (c) my personal interest, designer hobbyist board games. Del Amo has not one but THREE stores that carry these. Galleria has zero. Alas. On the plus side, there's a Panera Bakery and a Target within easy walking distance, so more options in that regard.< /text>

Great place for the movies, shopping, eating, hanging out with friends, and everything else. The parking levels are clean very spacious and secure. It's close to everything you need near the south bay.</text>

It's been A minute since I've been here. I mean YEARS. This Mall is dope! Soooo many stores & shops & some I've never seen! Wonder of dinosaurs & an AMC theater in here too. Everywhere was super clean, including the bathrooms.P eople were diverse & nice. The customers & associates we ran into. The kids wanted to go everywhere & we spent mega time window shopping & almost forgot about the reason why we came in the first place lol. The virtual reality place was packed & looked dope! Clearly gotta go back for that. Real talk visit here you won't be disappointed. Went over to red Robin too, decent burgers but good service. Check it out<//Text>

AMC "DINE-IN": TOTALLY SUCKS! You get in line FIRST... then the hot food is brought to your seat. You get  drinks and other things yourself. . like a regular theater. COMPARE with Ontario AMC DINE-IN to see for yourself! !!!!!! NEVER RETURNING HERE!!!!</Text>

One of the reasons I go to the mall is to kill time; this was no exception.  I was in the area for a meeting and having arrived really early, I decided to go to the South Bay Galleria to make time.  There is really nothing distinct about South Bay Galleria; having no stand-out shop or specials structural features.  On the time of my visit I found parking rather quickly.  As this was my first time at South Bay Galleria in order to orient myself with the location, I looked for a map of the facility.  Once oriented, I proceeded to go to the stores of interest, which were just two.  I was in and out in 45 minutes.<//review>

Security is to much here, I know security is important but not at the point that taking pictures is forbidden, after a security agent told me not to take pictures inside the mall, I didn't felt comfortable shopping anymore, was like behind the cameras they were following me so I left<//text>

Lots of different stores, the food court has some really good choices, and the AMC theater on the third floor is really nice as well and was just recently remodeled. There is always something to do here, even if you only come to window shop.< /Text>

I like the new renovation to this mall.
It is very fancy and the ceilings have no end. Lol it just seems like that..
My favorite is the ice fruit pops stand.
Its the first one I seen so far.
You can pick your favorite flavor pop, dip in sauce, and sprinkle some toppings.
So koool..... 😎</review>

Amazing mall!! More kid friendly for the family then Del amo. Bigger selection in food court the mall is smaller then Del amo but it is a better place to just hang out with your friends and see a movie and grab a bite. People are more friendlier and aren't so suspicious when you come in a store to buy stuff I can't handle rude people & I know I usually have a great time @ this mall specially the little train that roams the 1st floor for the children, cute family bathrooms and more selective stores in price range< /Text>

<Text>High end shops in the heart of Santa Monica. Parking is free up to a point. Though when I went this past holiday I paid before departing and the attendant just ended up waving me through without checking if I paid... doh. Nice location but can be to of tourists.

Pro tip: if you buy something from a high end store (i.e. Louis Vuitton) carry that bag into other stores. They'll treat you nicer. I call it the Pretty Woman effect.< /Text>< Date>

Interesting array of stores that are less mainstream. The loss of anchor stores like Nordstrom has created a vacuum of high traffic. Food court is OK. Parking is OK.</text>

First time coming and a "security" came to us at the food court and told us we can't wear our hoodies? or anytime of sweater that has a hoodie .. it sounds stupid? but why i come to the mall to enjoy a good day to be followed because we might steal ? Not being extra but you can't  just assume... Never coming back here......with that type of security i feel way unsafe than safe.<//Text>

Upgraded nicely ,but the Red Robbin here is not that great! SIGNup for the rewards, eat free on my birthday and that's it..I refuse to pay to eat at this location.  THE MAIL doesn't carry and American Eagle or most of the basic stores most malls have<//review>

I like the new renovation to this mall.
It is very fancy and the ceilings have no end. Lol it just seems like that..
My favorite is the ice fruit pops stand.
Its the first one I seen so far.
You can pick your favorite flavor pop, dip in sauce, and sprinkle some toppings.
So koool..... 😎< /Text>

<Review>AMC "DINE-IN": TOTALLY SUCKS! You get in line FIRST... then the hot food is brought to your seat. You get  drinks and other things yourself. . like a regular theater. COMPARE with Ontario AMC DINE-IN to see for yourself! !!!!!! NEVER RETURNING HERE!!!!<//Review>< pics>

Not the nicest mall but it's got the basics. The AMC on the third floor is nice. But the escalator system they have is kinda wack. This mall does not have the top of the line brands either.< /review>

<text>Most confusing mall layout ever. Obviously designed to keep you there longer. The in-view escalators all go up and the down escalator is in the corner,  between two stores, sometimes closed down. Prepare to wait at least 10 minutes for the elevator.
Some decent shops. I usually only go there for last minute gift shopping when I don't have time to go to Del Amo.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

< review>
It's the mall o my childhood, what is there to say? I cannot speak ill of it nor am I a fan of malls in general, so here's what stands out.

The movie theatre renovations have been generally well received, seeing the addition of a bar, a kitchen, and in theatre dining.

Food court is an ever changing assortment of "international" quisine, plus McDonald's and Hot Dog on a Stick, whose incomparable cherry lemonade draws menin every time.

VR Arcade I haven't visited, interesting spiritualist shop, and the Hermosa Beach second hand legend Granny Takes a Trip are worth your time (and money)

Plus Cinnabon...</review>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>One of the reasons I go to the mall is to kill time; this was no exception.  I was in the area for a meeting and having arrived really early, I decided to go to the South Bay Galleria to make time.  There is really nothing distinct about South Bay Galleria; having no stand-out shop or specials structural features.  On the time of my visit I found parking rather quickly.  As this was my first time at South Bay Galleria in order to orient myself with the location, I looked for a map of the facility.  Once oriented, I proceeded to go to the stores of interest, which were just two.  I was in and out in 45 minutes.</Text><user>104636687373132435944</user>< Gmap_id>

The area is a good spot for common brand names (H&M, Hot Topic, Spencers), quick bites (Mongolian BBQ, Napoli Pizza, McDonalds) and movie theatre (AMC). Not as fancy as Del Amo nor does it have much variety (one can easily browse the various stores and finish within ten minutes) It's a good middle range mall.</Text>

Its inside design is early 2000ish but its not bad to walk through, the theatre is amazing and i've seen it evolve since I was a child. The food court could be a lot better, its the smallest I have actually been to.<//text>

The Galleria is a small mall but is fair.  I had a very unpleasant experience with Swarovski.  I would recommend people to not buy anything from them.  I bought ear rings from Swarovski and decided to return them.  The store manager tried everything in her power to not let me return them for my money back.  Instead she offered me a deal to exchange them for different ones worth the same value and that I could return them for my money back if I was not happy.  I decided that I was still unhappy and wanted to return them for my money back.  I didn't realize that the store manager had switched the boxes on the new set of ear rings.  Because of this I was not able to get my money back due  to the box bar code not matching to my receipt.  The workers here are very dishonest and will trick you.  If you decide to shop here do not expect to get your money back for returns. I should have called the cops and filed a report for a fraudulent transaction.< /Review>

Lots of shops. Clientele and quality not as good as nearby galleria Mall.  It also has updated movie theater. There is a target nearby and that is convenient.</Text>

<text>The area is a good spot for common brand names (H&M, Hot Topic, Spencers), quick bites (Mongolian BBQ, Napoli Pizza, McDonalds) and movie theatre (AMC). Not as fancy as Del Amo nor does it have much variety (one can easily browse the various stores and finish within ten minutes) It's a good middle range mall.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2b4f97a0167a3:0xe4e4b4b9a5ecd026< /gmap_id>< Pics>

This use to be the best mall in the South Bay bit now that Nostrum has moved to Del Amo this mall has gone way done. Lots of vacant store fronts. Macy's store had large sections of the store closed off and merchandise was jammed together making it hard to move thru the store. Selections in all the stores were poor.<//Text>

<review>With the loss of Nordstrom, the mall doesn't have any good anchor stores. Macy's is there but it's old and the selection isn't very good for men.

On the weekdays, the mall is decently pleasant. AMC theatres is renovated which is nice. I still wouldn't see a movie there on the weekend due to the crowds.</review>< rating>

A good old-fashioned American Mall where one can find anything and everything that consumerism commands to get. South Bay Galleria offers a variety of food places, very nice movie theaters, the best department stores and the add-ons of national franchises outside the main body of the mall, such as Ulta Beauty, Panera Bread,  Islands, and let's not forget Target. The American dream come true.<//text>

Ever since Nordstrom left and went to Del Amo, the mall is not as crowded, which may be a good thing, I suppose. The food court is not real good, not enough variety.< /Text>

It's a standard mall. There are few unique stores or restaurants, but it's perfect if you want to get some clothes or accessories.< /Review>

<Review>IT HAS BEEN A WHILE SINCE I WAS HERE .... WOOOOOOOOOOOW .... A place for ALL SHOPPING NEEDS, PLUS places and events for the kids.  Parents can drop kids off at the Dinosaur Playstore Cafe.  3 levels to this place people.  And this is ALSO a good place 4 B~DAYS.  Specialty stores are placed throught the entire mall.  THE FOOD COURT IS A CHEF'S CANDY STORE (js).  U can even have ur car valed.  Like ALL of Beverly Hills, at the Beach, under on roof.  ENJOY & SHOP TIL U DROP. If U do that, take a rideshare !!!< /Review>< Pics>

<user_name>Lin D</user_name><Review>The Galleria is a small mall but is fair.  I had a very unpleasant experience with Swarovski.  I would recommend people to not buy anything from them.  I bought ear rings from Swarovski and decided to return them.  The store manager tried everything in her power to not let me return them for my money back.  Instead she offered me a deal to exchange them for different ones worth the same value and that I could return them for my money back if I was not happy.  I decided that I was still unhappy and wanted to return them for my money back.  I didn't realize that the store manager had switched the boxes on the new set of ear rings.  Because of this I was not able to get my money back due  to the box bar code not matching to my receipt.  The workers here are very dishonest and will trick you.  If you decide to shop here do not expect to get your money back for returns. I should have called the cops and filed a report for a fraudulent transaction.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2b4f97a0167a3:0xe4e4b4b9a5ecd026</GmapID><UserId.>108352129684839661476< /UserId.><date>1352650193976</date><pictures>None<//pictures><rate>3<//rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>It's a mall. Good variety of stores, food court is what you'd expect. Avoid the theater, half the people think every show is a melodrama -it can get annoying fast.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2b4f97a0167a3:0xe4e4b4b9a5ecd026</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This mall use to be a big deal back in the day. Nordstroms has been relocated to the del amo mall and now it's just Macy's and some struggling small stores. I like the movie theater though.<//review>

<Response>None</Response><review>The mall is very large, 3 floors but even that the store selections are mediocre. A lot of them are one of a kind knock off retailers that sell really cheap stuff. Not a bad thing. There are some good stores in there. Food court is boring like 4 Asian restaurants, they don't taste that good, McDonald's eww, pizza, Mediterranean, and some american food. And some major pastries scattered around the mall. Is worth a visit i guess...</review>< Rate>

I was sadly disappointed in the fact that the "Dine-In" is not truly dine in!! You have to order your food at the front counter and they bring IT to you....a whole hour + later. The bar...OH.. THE BAR!! The "bartender" who got his license 2 hrs before his shiFt started was HORRIBLE!!! BUT THE MOVIE...GIRL'S TRIP WAS GOOD!!!<//text>

<Text>I love the mall it's a very great experience and I came all the way from North Carolina and enjoying my stay in L.A. I will recommend that everyone check out this Business called REFRESHED SHOE CLEANER its amazing if anyone loves there merchandise and wants to make it last longer and keep your merchandise looking great just Like you bought it goto the booth upstairs on the third floor right across from the movie theater they sell a all natural organic product called Refreshed. Its good for all types of shoes all materials and since it has no chemicals it's good for your jewelry,couches,carpets,car seats dash board, REFRESHED WORKS GREAT ON EVEYTHING I LOVE IT AND KNOW THAT EVRYONE WILL ENJOY THEMSELVES SO STOP BY GET THE BEST ALL NATURAL ORGANIC PRODUCT AND  SERVICES LIKE I HAVE. VERY PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE. CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELVES</Text>< gmapID>

A good large staple mall.  flagship stores are Macys and Khols.  Food court with Panda Express, Hot Dog On-a-Stick, Mongolian Stir Fry, McDonald's, and is anchored by California Pizza Kitchen and Red Robin restaurants, and Starbucks.
Also, an AMC Theater which - I think just turned into a "dine-in" AMC theater.  Call ahead to double-check.
Clean, plenty of parking, a Bank of America ATM, and an Alterations business upstairs.
Also plenty of restrooms.<//text>

The South Bay Galleria and resturants surrounding it are awesome. South Bay Galleria has a theatre, Johnny Rockets, Train for Kids, H & M, Godiva Chocolatier, and many other things I bet you would enjoy. Surrounding it is some resturants I'd consider going to like Islands, Jamba Juice, and Panera Bread, It has a Nordstrom Rack and a big circus in the middle of the parking lot. It is 100% Kid Friendly, and I totally recommend it for anyone passing by, anyone within a 10 mi range and really believe me it's great!</Text>

Okay mall. Many of the shops have been closing down or moving to Del amo mall. Has a lot of the same stores that can be found a del amo and some that cannot. Overall, I think this mall is a great mall but lacks the numbers of people and the excitement of the shops when compared to del amo.< /Text>

It still has the AMC & sone decent clothing stores, sadly that's it. A lot of their business has left to the updated Del Amo Mall. New stores & small plaza came to the outside of the mall. It's a shame bcuz I really enjoyed bringing my kids here in the early 2000's, now it's a faint heartbeat. To the owner, please remodel & bring it back to life, I'd  hate to see this place completely shut down, it has the potential for new life.<//text>

It's a mall folks, you know, a bunch of stores built to support a Cinnabon. The place is friendly and clean. Only complaint is that the only restrooms are on the third level.< /Text>

The South Bay Galleria is just ehhhh. It seems to be dying out since the re-design of the Del Amo Fashion Center. This mall is filled with a bunch of high school kids in the evening not necessarily buying anything. The Nordstom here closed and it seems like other stores might be closing too if there isn't more foot-traffic soon. I visit this mall because of the Kohls, Ulta and food options that i can not find in Del Amo Fashion Center.</Review>

The Bath & Body Works carries CO Bigelow not too many stores do which is a good thing.  The parking lot is huge as they have an additional parking structure with 5 layers so parking is covered. I don't usually go shopping here but when I do I enjoy my experience.<//Text>

<Review>Went to the AMC theatre. Didn't like that you have to pick a seat at time of ticket purchase. Since I didn't know what seat I wanted without seeing the theatre first, I left without watching the movie and I don't think I'll be back.</Review>< time>

Went to the AMC for the Dine-in experience and was disappointed at how they do it. The whole point of Dine-in is to avoid the line, order at your seat, and have food delivered.< /text>

<Text>I like going to the mall but the kids train on the 3rd level makes me nervous. It passes through the smaller hallways on the 3rd level so you have to duck out of the way. There are also only glass barriers on that level, which don't look strong enough to hold back a train if the driver got distracted. Won't be taking my kid back there.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<text>(Translated by Google) I lived here for 3 months, and I went there a couple of times a week. I liked Express and I got along with the shop assistants, so I asked them to come out with new products.

It's not that big as a shopping mall, but I like it because I can see it without getting tired 😁

(Original)
３ヶ月住んでいたのがこの近くで、週に2～３回行ってました。Expressが好きで店員さんと仲良くなれたので、新しい商品が入ると声をかけてもらってました。
