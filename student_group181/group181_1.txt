The best cuisine in Orange County! A variety of vegetables the bean soup is perfect. I was able to substitute cauliflower in the mac and cheese with the most delicious white cheese sauce! One can substitute a cauliflower crust for a regular crust and their chopped salad is great. Something for everyone!</text>

My wife and I went to Pitfire Pizza in Costa Mesa on Friday night. We started off with turkey meatballs in marinara sauce. They were excellent. The turkey was obviously fresh, the meatballs were seasoned well, and the sauce was sweet but not overbearing.

I got the honey bear pizza, and my wife got the field mushroom pizza. With the honey bear pizza, you taste the honey and sausage first, and then you get a spicy delayed reaction with the Calabrian chiles. I like spice, so that made me quite happy. I have never had honey on a pizza before, but the sweet and spicy combination definitely worked. I understand why this pizza is one of their best sellers.

I love mushrooms, and the field mushroom pizza is definitely a winner. I could taste mushrooms and cheese in every bite. No part of either pizza overpowered the other.

The Orange County Register (local paper) recommended this restaurant, and we left quite satisfied. We look forward to a return visit.< /Review>

üëã howdy foodie fam! Happy National Pizza Day üçïüçï. Wait is it? Maybe not but might as well. I‚Äôm introducing you to my latest favorite pizza. If you know me, you know I don‚Äôt always order pizza. Hence I tend to be picky with what I want on my pizza.

üçÄ Lucky for me, Pitfire Artisan Pizza checked off all the boxes for me ‚òëÔ∏è. They have a pizza with burrata üßÄ, some types of veggies or greens like arugula üçÄ, with thin & crispy crust. I just described their The Burrata Pizza üçï. You must try it!! Other items are also delicious but this pizza totally got all of my attention.

‚ú® stay hungry & eat deliciously. Always!</review>

My new Kate Spade wallet arrived from New York! Since they had every color I needed, I was able to choose the best package. There was also a lot of lovely clothing on the premises. I'm wearing a new pair of heels that I brought with me. I'll return to this store in the future. The best shopping place!</review>

This is a gluten free review.

Ordered Zoe's Pepperoni on a gluten free crust and a side salad.

Pizza had fantastic flavor. A little over cooked, which made most of the crust inedible. I was also confused why I received croutons on my salad. The menu didn't say it came with croutons and I ordered a gluten free pizza. Nevertheless, the salad complimented the pizza well.

If it wasn't for the service, I would give this place 3 stars. The guy who took my order was super nice and threw in a free cookie for my wife.

If I'm in the area, I'll be back.<//text>

This cozy little Hole in the wall is designer pizza at its best. They dont overcharge for it either. It is priced exactly correct. We order the Honey bear which is an absolutely delicious seasonal order. Pre-covid this was our "get away" spot to eat and have a nice cold IPA. Couldnt recommend them more! The staff is super chill as well & never a dull moment! (ps. Ask to be seated "in the back" for datenight)< /Text>

<review>Friendly timely service. Kale salad was sooo tasty. Honey bear pizza with honey and bee pollen was well balanced with sausage and chili. Even the margherita pizza which u can get anywhere was exceptional. Cooked to perfection with a delicious sauce. They also gave my toddler clay to play with which was a surprising treat.<//review></record>

Pizza was solid.  Atmosphere just so so.  It was wood fired and the dough had the right balance of the soft and chew.

Can't remember the name but got the mushroom pizza from the menu and added roasted garlic.  Pretty thin crust just fyi. Its good crust.< /text>

Can't remember the name but got the mushroom pizza from the menu and added roasted garlic.  Pretty thin crust just fyi. Its good crust.</text></record>

‚ÄúPity‚Äù place for sure.
I wonder if they even have a manager in there.
Some people trying to order in the front desk for more than 10 minutes and nobody to help/
Very unprofessional workers overall . A bunch of careless youngsters.
Sad . Food always takes forever . Either dining in or ordering to go. Way beyond promised time.
Also several times the food is ready next to 2-3 employees and they can‚Äôt freaking take account for that food sitting on the corner with 2-3 ppl waiting on the lobby.
Sad
Pitiful for sure<//Review>

Waaaay too overpriced, for having to sit in the parking lot and being hassled about masks üò∑ pizza is alright; I'm over covid and what it is doing to the dining 'experience' and I'm annoyed with  the inconsistency from restaurant to restaurant on strictness of rules... watch it all go away, after the elections.  Until then,  get it to go.<//text>

First time here and it was a Friday about 7. The place was crushed. Surprisingly it didn't take that long to order. You walk to the counter and you order your pizza. They have plenty of set pizzas but you can build your own. This isn't Blaze or Pieology all the pizzas are made in the back in a large pizza pizza oven. The pizza size is a bit bigger than the other stores. If you split a salad and pizza with someone you'll have more than enough. I hade the Sausage Party and it was excellent. I also had a piece of the Honey Bear and loved it. The honey flavor was distinct. I'll order that next time. I added a side salad with balsamic vinegaret and that was very good too. They have some unique beers on tap but I had a homemade spiked lemonade which was tasty. The restaurant was large with plenty of seating and some very large tables. Larger parties work well here. The pricing was a tad high but the quality was very good and the ingredients were fresh. My pizza, side salad and cocktail were $30+.< /Text>

Order your pizza and drinks at the counter, and they'll bring them to your table when ready. Pick any of the several pizzas from the menu, or add toppings to your standard cheese pizza. They don't have anchovies, and that's the reason I'm not giving them five stars. They have high chairs and booster seats for kids, ample booths, and a nice bar in case you want a drink.</text>

This is now one of my favorite places for pizza in Orange County. They offer families a more upscale dining environment, and they have a lot of seasonal menu items - including healthy ones!

I brought our family here to dine recently and had a wonderful dinner. We started with the farmer's market vegetable plate and charcuterie board. The kids devoured every last vegetable and the meats were a wonderful start to our dinner.

I thought the pizza was going to be my favorite thing at Pitfire, but it was the salads that I could not stop eating. Their salads are large portions, and 2-3 people could easily share one before having some pizza. The steak salad was my favorite - a must when dining at Pitfire Pizza.

When it came to the pizzas, we had the bolognese pizza (seasonal) and the chicken pesto pizza. The pizzas are thin crust (my favorite) and have the perfect amount of sauce and cheese.<//Review>

Food was good. Fire cooked leaves an earthy taste to the food, very delicious.

Service leaves little to be desired. No one to greet at the door. First timers have no idea what's going on or what to do. My husband had to get up numerous times to ask for things. Gossiping employees & Playing on their phones.<//review>

Going to be totally honest, It was not great at all. My pizza had too much cheese and was soggy in the middle. The cheese knots were hard and my childrens pizza was burnt so bad on the bottom they couldn't eat it. I took a bite and it was like eating a badly burnt piece of toast. Definitely will not be ordering again, a total waste of money.<//text>

First time and loved the menu and the quality. Caesar salad is the best we‚Äôve had in OC! Chop salad is fresh, tasty and huge. Mushroom pizza was terrific. Back soon!</text>

Food is OK, but super loud place, and extremely slow. It took us more than half an hour to get a Nutella pizza... And the place wasn't crowded at all. Sorry but we won't come back!< /text>

<text>Came in today to try it out for my first time and absolutely loved it.. The great atmosphere and music was a real unique alternative from other restaurants..  Really enjoyed the fast efficient service and prompt food preparation.. Our server Aroje was great really nice and checked back on us periodically. We ordered the Burrata in which we were told that was their staple and it was definitely different and a wonderful surprise from any pizza ive ever head.. Definitely coming back..

We've come here many times.  The pizza is good but the customer services leaves something to be desired, hence the poor rating. We've always either dined in or picked up.  Last time I was there I inquired about delivery.  We live in HB, a little outside of their usual delivery area, but the guy who worked there said they could deliver for an additional $6 fee (that wouldn't, by the way, go to the driver).  When I called to try and place an order for delivery tonight, I was told it's not an option.  As irritating as the delivery issue was, what was more frustrating was that the guy who answered the phone - Dillon - was a dick for no apparent reason (mind you I did not have a poor attitude with him even though I probably could have justifiably been bitchy about it).  I've experienced dickishness from their staff when placing orders for pick up before (it may have always been this one guy, I haven't kept track), but have overlooked it, until now.  Their pizza ain't that good.  Won't be coming back to this place again.</text>

Great Happy Hour offerings and prices. Meatball app is huge and tasty, but a little bland on flavor. Would def recommend this place because the vibe is cool, people are kind and work hard.</review>

<text>Very impressed with this company. Ordered dinner online. Was in the restroom when it was delivered and it was left with my daughter. She dropped it and my dog ate it all! When I came out of the bathroom I damn near cried because it had been a long day and was starving! Called them and they were concerned and immediately offered to send out an identical order. I didn't have to ask, I didn't have to argue. You don't get customer service like this these days. They made it right without me telling them what to do.

Oh, and the food was amazing!! :)</text>< resp>

Saw the bartender and waiters scratching their hair and then touching glasses and silverwear.  Layout was bad, it's fancy vibe inside but takes forever to order up front for what looks like is a sit down restaurant.  They should either order while seated or design a better order system.  Would only consider delivery/takeout.</Text>< pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>The only saving grace of this place is the guy who ran the front counter. He let me try some of their local beers. He keeped pouring foam out of the tester cup because the beer was slightly warm.  Then a rude employee came out of the back and said I had 4 testers and I was cut off. I decided to get the only cold drink I could get (sangria) and sat down. I was then ignored by the staff at that point.  I watched as they ate, talked and played on there phones. Ignoring all 5 customers in the restaurant. I finally got frustrated I walked out.  NEVER AGAIN!

Note to owner.
Just so you know what staff you had working for you. I came in on Thursday March 29th at around 12:15 pm.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Always a good time at Pitfire Pizza. The Costa Mesa location is great - they are thoughtful with everything they do, from the amazing food to the art & design and community outreach. And the Pie Society Bar in back is stellar. Love'it!<//Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>I stopped with my family at Pitfire during a roadtrip from Los Angeles to San Diego, needing food and bathroom stop. We were very glad to have found Pitfire.

We ordered two specialty pizzas, and both were excellent. Thin crust, rich cheese, fresh-tasting toppings.

My 4-year-old daughter order the Mac n' Cheese, which was creamy and flavorful, and easy to please kids and adults alike.

My mother-in-law ordered the Grilled Chicken Panini, and surprisingly it was every bit as good as the pizza.

The service was fast and friendly, and the aesthetics was hip and clean. Definitely happy we stopped at Pitfire and would recommend it to locals and travelers alike.</Text>< Pics>

Came here a few weeks ago with co-workers, and it was delicious, but not 5-stars delicious. I got the kale salad, which was extremely good, but I felt like the portion was pretty small. I also tried (if I remember correctly) their pineapple sangria, which was actually very bitter and I was not a fan at all. There were a group of 7 of us, and considering it was after the lunch rush and the place only had maybe 5 or 6 other people in it, I felt like the service wasn't that great. They also ran out of softserve for their version of the pizookie when we asked for one.

Overall, my food was good, but I wasn't blown away by the overall experience.< /Review>

Great unique pizzas in Costa Mesa.  I got the green eggs and ham, and it's spinach, eggs, ham and cheese, no tomato sauce.  The eggs were cooked perfect, runny yolk for a sauce.  Thin crust and crunchy.  It only takes a few minutes for the pizza to cook.  They also let you add more toppings if it's on the pizza already.  You get a sausage and mushroom pizza, you can have them put more mushrooms on it.  I thinks that's right, somebody else can go and correct me.

This place was only open for business a few weeks before I went there.  It's quite a mess.  You go to the counter and order and pay, but then your waiter will take the rest of the orders and give you a bill.  The pepper flakes and cheese shakers were covered in butter and nasty.  They need to do a better job of cleaning.  They are working out some of the kinks still but in the end the pizza is worth it.

Chaos, new place but good food.  They only have a few tvs so it might not be worth going to for sports, but if you want to sit down and grab a decent pie, go here.<//text>

We went on a Tuesday night during an OCSPCA fundraiser event so we were having a night out while supporting the animals.  The sausage party pizza was one of the best I have ever had although it creates alot of jokes when ordering.  The chicken pesto pizza was also very good.  Woodfired oven gives such good flavor and crust is to die for and I usually leave crust behind.  Everything is fresh, beer is good and local.  There is a craft speakeasy bar in the back with the best from scratch cocktails ever.  Just tell the bartender what you are in the mood for and to make something original and you WILL be happy.</Text>

Well I don't know about these other guys, but I freaking love this place. Tis the bees knees; great foods (BOMB food), super friendly staff (I get along with them like their my longtime friends at this point), the seats are comfy (what more can you ask for), the music is dope (very important). This place is awesome. I was weary when this place first popped up, but its grown on me, and now its become a staple in the eatery side of my life.</Review>

This place is a little difficult to review because there are so many variables to deal with. I think I'll just break it down by category:

Food:
I've only ordered pizza here. I'm kind of/sort of a pizza snob, and I like their pizza very much. The brussells sprouts and bacon pizza is highly recommended, but unfortunately, it's seasonal. It's time to put that on the regular menu. The size of the pizzas are made for 1 individual. They're perfect for a person with a healthy appetite; someone with a smaller appetite should be able to take a slice home.

Beer:
I heard this place was going to cater to beer geeks. It doesn't. They serve a selection of fairly middle of the road craft beers (a step up from most places), but if you're the type of person who shops restaurants based on the tap list, you'll be left wanting. EDIT: they are sort of improving in this area.

Atmosphere:
It's a bit odd that you order, pay, take a seat, then somehow end up with a server again. I get it because you need to order more drinks, but it can feel a bit disjointed. We also had 3 different servers throughout the course of our dining experience, which didn't really help matters. That said, I do like the atmosphere. There's a quasi DJ spinning an iTunes playlist on his laptop on weekends, the room is big, and open, and the ambiance is such that you would feel comfortable on a casual date, or a quick meal with a few friends.

Parking:
They have a large parking lot.

Service:
I found the people working here to be friendly and helpful. It's a young, energetic crowd. There's lots of turnover; I'm a regular, but it's hard for it to feel that way with a rotating staff and management.

Policies:
They have a no corkage fee policy, which is great. I asked a server if I could bring in a special bottle of beer and she said, "I can't see why not. We have a huge "YES" on the door for that very reason."

Unfortunately, she was wrong. The policy is only for wine. Beer enthusiasts are left in the cold. I asked for an explanation because my corked bottle of beer that I brought in was more special (and expensive) than the $6 bottle of wine the person behind me in line was holding. The manager simply said, "sorry, it's our policy. Only wine. No beer."

Pie Society (speakeasy in the back):
This is a fun touch. They have classic cocktails along with their own craft cocktail creations. They run about $10-12 and are modest in size. They have a limited food selection that is slightly different than what you get in the main restaurant. Drinks take a long time to come, even when it's fairly slow, so keep that in mind when ordering.

Bottom line:
Except for the few criticisms that I mentioned above, I like the place, and I recommend checking it out. It's a great addition to what is already a nice selection of restaurants on 17th st.</text>

Horrible customer service. Called with a concern, was dismissively told to send an email, sent the email, got an automated, Unrelated reply with general information; called today to try to figure out what to do, got hung up on Twice. Now third time on the phone, got the same person, she said that she ‚Äúaccidentally must have hung up‚Äù, but at least this time she was actually trying to answer my question.</text>

Spoke with a representative named Liz who was entirely rude, dismissive, and unprofessional. She rudely interrupted me in the beginning when I was trying to explain my licensure situation saying ‚Äústop, stop, stop, stop!‚Äù before I could explain to her that I‚Äôm moving back to California and needed to see if I just should renew license or if reciprocity is required. I was calling to get some guidance since I was misled by the board of licensing out here in Utah. Please advise and teach your representatives to engage in active listening before making assumptions on what the subject of the call matter is about. We could have cut out a lot of back and forth had she just listened to the situation from the get-go.</text>

This place is a joke. Shut us down for months and have no type of Covid assistance for fees. I feel bullied and completely taken advantage of. They do this because we have no options. The state of California is a worse.<//text>

I was given the wrong information. I again went the following Monday I asked specific questions trying to resolve this issue and the woman I  front had no idea what was what! So I went to consumer affairs building where I was sent l and then sent back to the board and finally spoke with the manager who was very helpful! She gets 5 stars hut my overall experience was awful. And I call I cannot get through I get disconnected. I even spoke with the manager at consumer affairs and he was no help at all, seemed to not care and could not come up with a solution when I asked him to help me solve this problem. Another gal was there having an issue trying to get her license in CA as well.<//review>< UserId.>

<Text>They do their best to insure that every salon is safe for customers. I only wish that they would make the Asian nail salons live up to the same quality and hugh standards as they do American owned salons...i know of a nail salon that is so dirty..and when i asked the owner if he's visited by state board much he laughed and said they haven't been here for 6yr..</Text>< Resp>

I had an inspector check my office, I keep the area very clean and up to standards. I have a dry heat sterilizer as approved in sec 982 of the booklet. The inspector said I have to have a auto clave, she wrote me a citation and took a picture of the dry heat sterilizer when it says we clearly can have a dry heat sterilizer or an autoclave.

Once I got the information in the mail I called state board to ask if they had seen the picture of the dry heat sterilizer and that I do have that on the premises, they said there was no picture. I saw the inspector take a picture of it and she decided to leave this information out to give me a fine? For something I did right? That‚Äôs crooked! She purposely deleted the photo so I would have to pay $500.
Now I have to wait months for this appeal process and I do have a receipt of the dry heat sterilizer to prove it so if I don‚Äôt win then I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs right anymore..

The messed up part is we are all here to do a job and for someone to get in trouble for doing everything right? Is wrong, the system they have is wrong and creates inaccurate accusations.

The inspector didn‚Äôt understand the rules or she would have known not to cite someone for it something that is clearly in the current handle book of rules and regulations< /text>

Get ready to be treated like an idiot and cut off in the middle of everything you say. Verry upset after speaking with vanita on a number of occations.. she is extreemly rude and unprofessional. I asked to be transferd to her supervisor so i could speak to someone about  her attitude and she just transferd me to a different department where i talked to another rude and cranky guy. This department needs to get there act together. Verry cranky and unprofessional people. I used to work at a call center myself so i know how it can be stressfull but vanita needs to think about getting a new job no one deserves to be treated like that.< /Review>

<Text>This place is hands down the worst. Everytime I call I literally hear them answer the phone and hang it up. This is ran by the state and it's ridiculous. How can one trust in this system if they're letting us down? Might as well be ran by some company not being paid by the state seeing as these people don't care about anybody in this industry.<//Text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) There they allude us to obtain the licenses of cosmetology or barber shop even if one has not done his studies in this country.

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>This place always has awesome prices! There were times where they were running low on livestock such as saltwater fish but I still ended up buying something else such as a used protein skimmer good for a 100g tank for only $65 cause the price was that good!... a bargain!
And I can see why their livestock doesn't stay for long cause their prices are the best I've seen from surrounding saltwater fish stores. For example, I bought a healthy Blue tang (Dory) for only $44! The best price I've seen for this fish at around a 2 inch size was for $60. I also bought a very beautiful  healthy specimen of a flame angel for only $40 bucks.  I've already had them in my tank for a few weeks now and they are eating well and swimming around healthily. I had bought a Blue tang from another fish store in the past and it had died on the second day! And of course the return policy on saltwater fish are almost nonexistent so that was a disappointing experience from the other store.<//review>< pics>

Pretty good selection of fish. Only two freshwater tanks currently, but they're planning to add more. Overall as time goes by and the store becomes further established, I expect it'll be pretty cool. They already have a good selection of saltwater fish and coral - rays, flowerhorns, chichilids, clowns etc.< /Review>

<text>Derek is seriously the best along with the rest of his staff. Our family is new to the tank ownership and fish world, but we love it. They answer our questions fully, every time, with compassion and patience. It goes a long way when someone is trying to learn a new hobby. Not to mention them moving and setting up our new tank. We're extremely pleased and just cannot say enough good things about them. Thank you all!!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1588519303018, 'text': 'We appreciate the kind words!

For months I dodged having these guys come over to clean my tank. I thought I knew it all and could do it myself. They never pressured me just told me when I‚Äôm ready they will see the service difference. I called them up and they took about two hours on my 80 gal tank. 4 days later and it‚Äôs still so vibrant, the algae is all but gone the glass is clean residue free and I am enjoying my corals and fish again.<//review>

With fish being so unpredictable and fragile we have certain standard procedures we follow which is why our associate must of given you the answer they did. If people swapped out fish when one doesn‚Äôt work out then the fish are exposed to stress repeatedly, possible diseases and we will loose track of where fish are coming from, prices, etc. To mitigate this we try our best to make sure each fish that goes out is going into an appropriate tank but each fish and situation is unique. With that in mind we would like to help you, please text us on our support number (951)\xa0468-0699 and we will be happy to resolve this for you. Thank you'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Deep Sea Creations is the cleanest and friendliest fish store between the city of Escondido and Orange County. The staff members are extremely knowledgeable in both fresh and saltwater. Whether it's Kyle, Bobby, Kevin, Ryan, or even Madison, all of the employees at this store genuinely care about the customer's needs. And Derick, the fantastic owner, makes sure that everybody who walks through the stores' front doors gets met with knowledgeable staff members that are willing to help in any way possible. Even if you are new and know nothing about fish at all, the employees at this fish store will guide you through every step of the way. I have gone to this fish store many times, and not once was I ever pressured into buying or trying something because this store prides itself on putting customers interests first.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80db7f55ae5f9159:0x5c9d6b6ff8328a97< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great aquatic store. Will take the time to answer your questions and try to solve your struggles. Awesome options for aquascaping. More tanks than most local aquatic stores. Sells a wide variety of Seachem products and is willing is special order a product if they don't regularly carry it. This store has a great RO/DI water program in which you can buy gallons and get some back free. I have not visited any other store that has a program like this. Will be returning and even though this is the furthest store from me (45 minutes) it seems to be worth the drive.< /review>< userid>

<review>Kyle was very helpful with me finding a blue ram I wanted for my a gift for my roommate, he took the time on the phone with me to check before I wasted my time heading from Murrieta to the store. I have been to the store prior to this which is beautiful. I breed Chameleons and fresh water fish is not an area I am to familiar with, thanks for the help Kyle.<//review>< resp>

They have a great variety of fish mostly salt water though was hoping there would be a lot more freshwater fish like half salt half fresh but its more like 70% salt and 30% freshwater. But any ways these guys know what there doing because my mom was asking them questions about owning and maintaing a salt water tank and they were really helpful. They also got tons of supplies that won't be found at any local pet shop< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Not sure if they are going through a transition of some sorts but this was NOT the store it once was. 3/4 of the tanks we're empty, and the place was a mess. The guy at the register didn't even give so much as a second glance to me or my girlfriend when we walked in. No hello or anything. I am sure that I won't be back though.<//Review>

I cannot say enough about how great this place is. The best experience I have EVER had as a customer.

I was 2 1/2 hours into a family vacation driving from San Diego to the Eastern Sierras  when my truck broke down in Adelanto.   It was a Saturday and the truck could not be looked at until Monday.   I was on the way to visit the place where my husbands' and my dads' ashes are, so the idea of not making it was devastating.  I was at the Automotive Center Monday at 8:00 am when they opened, expecting to hear that my truck could not be looked at for days.  Travis, the general manager, met me immediately and was already familiar with the situation and assured me that they would have me back on the road THAT day. I was beyond relieved and SO grateful.  Everyone was helpful, supportive and kind from the office staff who took our call, the tow truck driver who gave me a hug when I was crying, and everyone in the office. It was also the cleanest automotive center I have ever seen, even the work bays were clean!  I was able to meet my family with only a day lost of my trip and make many great memories.  THANK YOU to everyone who helped me, I am forever grateful!!!!< /text>

<review>G&M is amazing. We have taken our vehicles to them for years. They have great mechanics and the entire shop, inside AND out is the cleanest I've ever seen any shop. They keep in touch with you so communication is never an issue. They are always friendly and you will know within minutes of speaking to anyone that they really take pride in what they do and put their customers first. We will never take our vehicles elsewhere else. You will not be disappointed if you bring your vehicle here! Thank you for keeping our vehicles in great shape and keeping them on the road for us!! Plus, have you ever picked your car up from the shop and it's clean? We appreciate the wash since our vehicles are always covered in dirt. Thank you G&M for all the hard work!<//review>< pictures>

I had my truck towed here and I was supposed to know something the next day because I verbally gave consent to diagnose it. Well, the next day came and an hour before they close I finally called them because noone would reach out to me or keep me informed of what the diagnosis was for my truck. Anyway, Jim said they were a half a day behind and it would be the next day. Jim was very rude to me on the phone and at that time I felt as though I had made a mistake towing my truck there. Finally the 3rd day I called to find out something and Travis said that they were working on it but could not give me a time. This was around 12:30 pm so at that time I decided to bring my truck home. I went there around 2pm and my truck was still being diagnosed. I said that I would like to just have my truck towed home because they've had it too long and I still do not know why it's reving up to 6000 RPM'S.  Travis was rude and at that time stated that it was not the intake manifold. So all this time with my truck there at this shop, I thought these guys would not drive my vehicle because of the RPMS being danderously high and because Jim reassured me that they would not and would only push it into a stall to work on it.
But, while on the phone with AAA I see my truck drive by me and I asked Travis why it's being driven? He shrugged his shoulders and was rude. So I told AAA to please send someone because these guys are the rudest and I no longer want to deal with them. I cannot even rate these guys because they were unprofessional, rude and drove my vehicle at 6000 RPMS. IDIOTS!
Well, I guess in order to post this review, I had to give them a star. They don't even deserve this star! As I read the other complaints I notice that Travis deflects instead of taking responsibility! UNPROFESSIONAL AND A LIAR!

I just read a response from Travis (owner). Like I said, he's deflecting not taking responsibility and he is most definitely lying so why would I call him to speak about the matter?
These are the FACTS: I was driving to his shop to meet the tow truck driver when he called and said I do not need to. Then a bit later he called and asked for verbal permission to diagnose my truck and said that they have an intake manifold there in stock and it would cost around $500 for the part if it is in fact the problem. But, it needs to be diagnosed first and would be finished with the diagnosis the next day. I did not ever sign anything for them to work on my vehicle. He did not keep me in the loop about the progress on my truck and I had to call the shop. Not to mention one of his mechanics, David I believe was his name, drove my vehicle at 6000 RPM's which is very dangerous for the motor and trans! These guys are rude and unprofessional, especially to a female who has an educatetion. I would  not recommend for anyone to bring their vehicle here. This is the type of shop that would possibly break something trying to fix something else and charge the vehicle owner for their mistakes.
So these guys had my truck for 3 days and it was towed there because of the RPM's being at a dangerous 6000. They are covering up the fact that they're SHADY! These guys call themselves professionals? RIGHT, SURE THEY ARE!üëçAnyway, the place where my truck is now had it for a little over an hour and found 2 problems right away. One was dangerous because it was a gas leak from the fuel pressure regulator and the other was a part for the idle. Another issue found was the intake manifold which had a huge hole in it. According to Travis that was never an issue when his mechanic was diagnosing my truck.
Although other clients may have had a good experience dealing with this shop, I DID NOT! And, the public needs to know. I mean, that is the point for these reviews.
When you trust someone with your vehicle they should be honest, understanding, courteous, and professional. Which these guys were not. Especially with me! AAA really should remove them from their approved shops!!!!<//review>

I can not express enough, my gratitude for this company and Travis!
I am from Northern Calif and my car broke down just outside of Bakersfield. I had my car towed to a dodge dealership where it sat for 3 days because they could not accommodate me.
G&M went to Bakersfield and retrieved my car and within a day it was fixed. Travis is my hero!!
Full disclosure through out the whole process. I highly recommend G&M for any auto need.</review>

I highly recommend Hesperia  Transmissions since they successfully identified the problem of my vehicle after the fact that two previous Shops had failed to do so. Bob eagerly persisted on solving the problem.

Travis is always great to work with. I feel confident in taking my vehicles there because they are trustworthy. I can trust they will get the work done and give me an honest assessment of what needs to be done. There is no up sell. They do only what is needed to keep your vehicle operating safely. The prices are fair which make the overall value excellent!</text>

Unexpected serpentine belt ripped. Trip back from LA to Las Vegas .. I googled G & M came up. it‚Äôs was such a blessing for me. Travis was the best and the tech got me in about in a flash an on my way back home. Being a business owner I know how important customer service is. G & M is 5 star all the way around. Other companies take note. Thanks again and keep up the great work.. you‚Äôre the best!!!< /Review>

<text>I had to find another repair shop after my previous repair shop cut way to many corners.  I‚Äôm a busy girl and need a fast and reliable mechanic.

G&M not only fixed my car he caught so many irregularities that the previous mechanic left me to deal with. Irregularities that could have caused so much damage to my Porsche. I‚Äôm thankful for G&M. He was fast, knowledgeable and had my car running like the performance car it is. It‚Äôs hard to find honest and hardworking businesses these days. I‚Äôm so happy I found A Professional Mechanic who cares about his customer.<//text>< pics>

Travis was exceptional.   These people really care about their customers.  We had to drive back to Canada and we called a few times and they never got impatient and were so helpful.   They offered that if we needed to call any time they would be happy to help.   This was after they were paid so the only motivation was true caring.   They dropped us off and picked us up.   I can't say enough to explain my gratitude.   Thank you Travis & Staff.<//review>

Days of Professional service follow up and customer service may be numbered there at G&M now that the son has taken over operations. I brought my truck in complaining of a noise from the engine. Not being a mechanic myself, I asked for a Valve Adjustment believing that to be the issue. Driving it off the lot after, the noise was still there. I went back to let them know the original symptom was still there. I have been informed that they do not "Test Drive" vehicles after work is done and they performed only the job I had ordered. Taking it elsewhere, the problem source was identified in 10 seconds and has since been repaired. Problem was an Exhaust Leak, a symptom any Professional would have easily diagnosed if interested. My suggestion, shop around. You saw what Sam Winston's kids did to the business at Winston's Tires!
In response to your response, I never mentioned "preventive maintenance" but rather mentioned numerous times about the "noise", being the only reason I brought it in. I guess 5 years wasn't long enough. At least this gave me the opportunity to find another place in town for diesel service. couldn't be happier now so thanks, Travis. Things happen for a reason.</Text>

G&M is Amazing!!! I always take my 2015 Jeep Cherokee there for simple things such as regular oil changes and bigger things when things go seriously wrong with my car. They are always so kind and honest! They always get my vehicle fixed as fast as they can! I‚Äôve never had a bad experience taking my car here!!! Thank You G&M Team for all you have done for me!!!! I always feel so much safer driving myself and my son in my car knowing that I‚Äôve had the best people working on my car!!</Text>

Worst service ever. Tow response for dead battery was awesome but service at the shop was horrible. Told in advance they could do an oil change while I waited, got there and they said too busy and cant do the oil change at all. Waiting almost two hours for them to install a new battery. Won't be back ever!<//text>

Had smog check performed on 10/22/19 without an appointment and was out the door in about 30 minutes.  G&M has performed all services on my vehicles for many years and always has done the job right the first time. Thanks Jim!</Text>

First time here and it was a little overwhelming on how many flavors were available, I had to pull up the flavors online to see what they were, but after we decided what we were getting, the payoff was worth it.  It was so good, this is the kind of place where you have to go once a week to try all the flavors.  I am betting that most of them are really good.  And as far as ice cream goes it's reasonably priced for the amount you get.<//Review>

<Text>My first job was an ice cream place, & we had hourly rotation to empty trash cans & clean the glass on the entry doors. I'm bringing this up because the outside of Handel's was scruffy. The inside was clean.
They have an amazing assortment of very good ice cream. I had a double in a chocolate dipped wafer cup, which is easier to eat than cone.
Worth the trip, quite good. P<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

What a great place to enjoy the end of my Mother's Day! This was awesome! This was my first time coming with husband and my three young children. The icecream sure was the best I ever tasted. We all ordered one scoops and it looked like we gotten three. It's was huge! This place has excellent customer service and the owners were the best. They came out to greet my family, which made us want to come back. I highly recommend this icecream shop to everyone.< /text>

Can get wait busy on the weekends, so expect a line though it usually moves pretty quick.  They have a lot of very delicious options and the staff is always very friendly and helpful, especially if you bring in your little ones.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>The first thing I noticed was the clean look. Next I saw all the interesting, delicious sounding flavors! The employees were friendly and helpful and told us that we can try as many flavors as we wanted, so we tried a few. All were great!! My boyfriend got Tin Lizzy in a cone and I got Monkey Business in a cup. Both were amazing! (Although my boyfriend felt like it was a bit too sweet after a while.) You can really taste the quality and freshness of the ice cream, and you get a really generous amount for the price. I wish I lived in Folsom - I would come here all the time!!</review>< Pictures>

Best ice cream in town! Handel's has so many delicious flavors, my only complaint would be that it's so hard to choose my favorite! They make new ice cream every day, keeping things fresh. The atmosphere is clean and organized, making ordering very efficient. They have nice outdoor seating, but there are tables inside as well. The service is unbeatable, and they're a great employer for teens looking for a first job. Lauren was especially great; she was able to memorize our order for 6 people in one try. Handel's has been a great edition to Folsom, and my family looks forward to visiting a lot this summer!</Review>

Great tasting ice cream. Many, many flavors to choose from (standard favorites to delicious combinations).  Great neighborhood creamery with a friendly staff.  Social distancing amid the pandemic could be better enforced.  Customers are spaced 6 ft. out at the counter when ordering and paying.<//Review>

She shorted us on our milkshake and when we asked for extra think we didn't get it and was charged for regular. Luckily my fiance and i were just enjoying our occasion but we both agreed to just make sure our associate isn't pulled away. This place is amazing however and one out of the million trips i have been there being a mediocre one proves that they are worth going to see. Love there milkshakes.<//review>< pics>

The 1st time I came here, I ordered the 4 scoop sampler to try different flavors and they were all amazing. They did not skimp on ingredients, there were so many whole pistachios in pistachio, whole cherries in black cherry, bug chunks of peanut butter and brownie and so much flavor in the monkey. Best ice crean I ever had.
The 2nd time that I came here, I wanted to bring my mom to try the pistachio and black cherry ice cream because it's her favorite. Unfortunately, there were were barely any pistachios in the ice cream; i was disappointed that I didn't prove to my mom that this was the best. Not sure if it was a hit or miss but my mom wasn't impressed, but she liked the black cherry. The peanut butter choco brownie was still good though. Hopefully the pistachio will be better next time.</text>

<Review>Recently heard of existence on the news. Decided to take a drive from Sac and give them a try. Ordered a choc banana, pt of blueberry pie, and qt of Twister. Ice cream was thick, creamy, and super flavorful....look forward to trying other flavors. Choc banana seemed like it had seen better days but it was still a tasty treat. Hoping others come out to support during the Shelter in Place.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>Oh wow. I would argue they are as good as Gunther's and definitely better than Leatherby's. Rotating flavors. Generous portions. Vegan and non-dairy options are available (but small selection). Worth the trip if you're in the Sacramento area.</Review>< username>

< review>
I found this place a couple weeks ago on the way back from Folsom Lake we frequent. Always looking for place to eat after and dessert. We usually go to gunter's in Sacramento but usually have to rush before they close, also there's leatherby's but their a rip-off and not that good. but this is lots closer and a good deal and selection of ice cream and different ways they serve it. So fun and full of yum!<//review>

Best ice cream in town.
Also, in reference to the below bad review due to lack of social distancing.... this is an ice cream shop and their ice cream is delicious. I‚Äôm sure you can find social distancing at the local social distancing shop. Your review has zero reference or taste. Get it together, Karen.</text>

<text>Went to Handel‚Äôs Folsom last night and was upset to find at least 30 unmasked patrons seated and congregated in front of the door. No one eating ice cream, just socializing. I had to excuse myself through a crowd of unmasked patrons to get to the door. All patrons inside also unmasked. While CA Covid-19 numbers are up 70% this is downright dangerous AND unlawful. Patrons are to have masks in public, and inside the building at a minimum. Won‚Äôt be going back until something is done about this.< /text>< resp>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>Went there with my husband and son. The store was packed and was not enforcing social distancing. They did not have any system in place to keep the customers away from each other. There were only young kids working and not all of them were wearing their masks properly and a few with no mask at all. No management directing customers to practice social distancing? Not to mention the Dutch apple pie ice cream had zero flavor. Not impressed.  Get it together Handels.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Very good ice cream. Reminded me of another family owned creamery called Leatherby's in Sacramento.  Generous portions, good spread of variety... Need to improve the ambiance of this place. Looks more like a clinical dairy farm rather than a family creamery!< /Text>

If you love choices & rich, creamy ice cream Handels fills the bill. Chocaholic Peanut Butter Ripple & Oree Dough. 1 quart of ea  because we couldn't agree on just one. Our visiting family agrees,  "it's the best ice cream, ever!!" The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, too!<//text>

Ice cream was great. So thankful they have vegan options! Only complaint I have is that they only had one person working when we went in and it was pretty busy. I felt bad for the poor kid! But he was as fast and efficient as he could of been by himself!< /Text>

Ice cream was smooth and creamy. Single scoop was on the generous side; I would prefer a smaller size for a smaller price. It was good though, probably best ice cream in town.

Ambiance is really loud and echoes across the room. I went when a room full of sugared up kindergartners were there... Loud!!! I'd recommend a smaller size and something to muffle the noise inside.<//review>

The best ice cream in Folsom and beyond!!! Always fresh, interesting flavors and great customer service! My favorites are banana cream pie and mint Oreo cookie. Don't miss this if you are in town! It would be good if they could add more outdoor seating, but I'm happy to stand for ice cream that is this good!</text>

Handel‚Äôs is a dream come true for the region! We had an incredible Graham Central Station, Cinnamon Roll, Watermelon and Oree Dough. To say these were good does not cut it, they were so creamy so fresh and so rich and amazing absolutely the best ice cream we have had in a while. The watermelon specifically made me want to put down any Jamba Juice and drive over to Handles to get a cup it was such pure fruit filled bliss. The service was fantastic with letting us try as many flavors as we wanted we will be back regularly every time we are in Folsom for sure.< /review>

Icecream is really good, very generous scoops, clean and nice atmosphere, and all the workers are nice. Caramel pretzel crunch is a must try! The girl with the Medusa piercing also knows what's in every single ice cream, I tested her while sampling all 50 flavors.<//review>

<review>I cannot express how excited I am to have this open in Folsom. The choice of flavors is overwhelming, yes, (although they are so friendly and happy to give you lots of tastes!), and having such delicious, homemade ice cream available close by may *not* be the best thing for my waistline (understatement of the year). But wowza. I can‚Äôt wait to go back this weekend and try a sundae!<//review>< Pictures>

handels in folsom is a super yummy spot! i went today AND yesterday! its well priced and their out of the box flavors are absolutely delicious! their milkshakes are to die for, yet they are only $5.50. if you go to cold stone, niche, snooks, etc. the milkshakes are smaller, more than $6, & mediocre.</Review>

< Review>

<text>Pretty much the same quality as any other Jamba Juice. The company started here in SLO, which is a fun little fact. This was their first main location.

Aside from that, this location seems to be particularly noisy and busy, no matter when you go. There's always a long line, and as they are located downtown, you'll need to park somewhere and walk, making it difficult to just stop in quickly for a smoothie.</text>< Pics>

A good location, but the one on chorro is better. However, this place has bathrooms and a couple tables inside and outside. Good smoothies!<//review>

Never really a fan of Jamba Juice. All their smoothies just use sugary juice. Try somewhere local that uses fresh/frozen real fruit instead.</Review>

All were great except the marlin, just too fishy for my taste.  The table next to us has oysters and a seafood bowl- both looked fantastic.
The service was quite good.
The restaurant was clean and had cool hand carved furniture.
I‚Äôd recommend this place if you want Mexican style seafood- that‚Äôs what they do very well!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM89-wvSBdKXOGLh87WCxi1po6CJ7K_yjBFYONI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2CbtTSSvUlu8H8zMFqOwAvqt7ngt60wgg3QeC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBX2t6r1CIH8puZMZ8U3wzzc3V6LPtM9uTF6Ac=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

<review>I love their grilled Octopus which I had twice, my husband ordered the garlic fried one and it was equally good. We also ordered whole beans as side, great flavors. Good service both times, relaxed clean environment with lively Mexican music.
If price is not the biggest concern, this is indeed a great place to dine for Mexican seafood.</review><response>None</response><Name>Sreejaya Bhattacharjee Godfrey / Olga</Name><rating>5< /rating><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

A lot of people have criticized this place for its prices, but seafood isn't cheap and the prices aren't that steep. There is a wide variety of items and sauces and everything we had was quite tasty. This is authentic Mexican food that is entirely different from anything else available in the area.</Text>

<Text>They service was a little slow, but hey it's Tuesday night. Other than that, this place was satiating. The Goyza were crunchy. The No Name Special Roll was creamy and light with sparring rice. I dont even like Lobster, but I couldn't stop eating the popcorn Lobster on the Super Diablo Roll.
The absolute topper though, was by far the Tempura Fried Green Tea Ice Cream... I will go back just for desert!<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy5zLYQ82XAcEcMk5p1fXI62xUnjqSV3MGfHuy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcRkfJFyT-HrgxgmYxzdYNXcS3memPi-0-4d-r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPq_ja9eWTUFusD6sOugd_dGg05htZ7CALh1G2E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODkfbL3q1mVb4TqCHXubNSG0iVbcr8MBqEmcle=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-yM-zczFVfawQGhIfqnL--Orn1qYwTvO7j3wr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Honestly, 4 all u sushi lovers & enthusiasts who r willing 2 try new places/things, I would NOT recommend this place. Their sushi isn't worth the price & little amount they offer. Example:Golden Vegas Roll-12.49/5 rolls versus the usual 6/8 rolls for this price. It's cool if u just wish 2 try something new, but not a return visit< /Review>< Pics>

<date>1561156346746< /date><Rate>1<//Rate><text>We ordered 2 "bento box" item lunch specials. It was HORRIBLE! The teriyaki salmon was a premade fish patty that found in any grocery store frozen isle. The hot green tea was served in a mug with a green tea bag obviously NOT Japanese. The fried rice was cold & tasted like it had been sitting there all day. The tempura was SUPER greasy. The spicy tuna rolls had no flavor. The miso soup tasted like an instant soup mix. The food I make at home shouldn't be fresher than the quality of a sushi bar. Which is very worrisome, because the chef is supposed to be provided with top grade fresh fish. Which obviously this restaurant does not have access to.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEQ_pJwSyapS5P3UdnpGYIne-Ag54VBK6CZQ0H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I have been eating at Summa Sushi every Friday night for over three years. Normally end up eating there a few times a week. Love the freshness of fish, size of servings, selection. The staff alwaays greets me and treats me fantastic. Best Sushi restaurant I have found in many years. Recommend<//Text>

<text>We stumbled upon this great sushi restaurant by happenstance and we're very glad we decided to give it a try. A large variety of rolls made choosing just one difficult, but I don't think you could go wrong with any. The fish was fresh, tender and delicious. And the rolls are quite large. This place is now on my radar for a good meal on the road! Not to be missed!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>Don't waste your time!! Not busy but the roll look sloppy, and a basic roll is priced as something special. Got a black dragon roll and the I have to say what eel? Feel like it was mainly eel skin. Also got a shrimp tempura roll and yeah barely any shrimp tempura. Def need to step up their quality.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c34941040ea031:0x43082db64dca02f6<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I don't usually write reviews but hopefully this helps out someone. I ordered through door dash a $60 order. My rolls were all poorly done (shaped sloppy, not wrapped properly, drowned in sauce) and the fish wasn't fresh at all. I ended up throwing most of it out, and I'll probably end up being sick from eating what I did eat. I've had better quality sushi from grocery stores. This was a disappointment for sure and I will not be a returning customer.</Text>

<Review>I've been going to this place for years now and I've never have been disappointed with any of their dishes and service! They can take longer than normal sometimes on busy days but the wait is very much worth it! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for high quality food!</Review>< Pictures>

I really enjoyed this restaurant. We ordered all of the specials and I sampled all of the sakes. I thought the price was very reasonable for uniquely prepared japanese inspired dishes. We will return and a bonus is Cafe Trieste is a few doors away.< /review>

<Text>The ambience was great but the food tasted like it was previously frozen.  The beef on the kids plates was undercooked and had to be sent back.  The calamari tempura tasted like it came from a bag but my wife enjoyed her sushi roll.  I got noodles with beef and it was good but could have used some more spices.</Text>< pictures>

<review>I think people are being too generous with the star rating for this place
At first walk in, no real place to sit/wait.
Atmosphere is kinda quiet.
At times it gets warm and uncomfortable while eating. Seems A.C is costly to them.
They also take a bit of time to take orders,should ask for drink when seated or else you will have to wait even longer for food . Restrooms are OK clean.
This place is overpriced for the quality, and there plating appears amateur.

Crispy Rice Roll!! They fry a rice ball and place spicy tuna and cream cheese and jalape√±o peppers on the top and then if that wasn't enough they smother it with fried onions! Come on now  5 stars for that dish alone.</review>

<Text>Food was really good but the service was horrible.  Waited 10mins just for water an a soda.  The bus boy helped us out more then the servers.  I guess you have to give up service for good tasting food.<//Text></record>

The food was okay, the price was a little high and the atmosphere was a little cramped. The biggest turn off was when a huge cockroach appeared on the wall above us after we had already eaten. Needless to say i don't think i will ever go back here again, which is pretty unfortunate because i live so close.<//Review>

<review>The workers here are RUDE, My husband and I (including 3 families behind us) stood at the front door for 15 mins only to be asked by a rude waiter ‚Äú Did you sign in?‚Äù We didn‚Äôt know we had too. He didn‚Äôt apologize for the long wait and said you guys can sit at the bar if not your gonna have to wait 45 mins and turned his back! For 15 mins no one even acknowledged us or the guest behind us. NO HELLO, No Welcome, no nothing just walked right by all us repeatedly.On our way out the guest who were already seated said that have been waiting 25 mins just for their drinks and advised us to not waste our time. Everyone that was waiting with us was immediately turned off by this rude waiter ( and waitress who totally ignored ALL 13 GUEST) We all walked out. This was ‚Äú A first impression‚Äù we had never been here before and unfortunately will not return.

Customer service however...is HORRIBLE. we were seated and waited at least 10 mins just to get our water. Then waited another 10-15 minutes for our order to be taken and there were hardly any people in the restaurant. My cousin ordered two different kinds of sashimi. The way they have the sushi and sashimi listed on the menu is: Sushi & Sashimi..it's lists the different types they have and ONE price. We got the bill and the price for each sashimi was double. He asked her why the price wasn't what is ON the menu and she said that price is for the sushi only. Ok then why the hell do you only list one price. If the sashimi is a different price or varies then put a SEPARATE price for the damn sashimi. She had the nerve to say "well most people just know that it's a different price"  REALLY?! Well my cousin who came here for the first time and ordered sashimi for the first time did not know. Fix your damn menu. Hire more staff or at least staff that can handle 2 tables at a time. If anybody is thinking of eating here..dont. There are plenty other sushi restaurants around that has better food and way better customer service AND some places will even give u complimentary miso soup and ice cream. Just saying.<//Review><Rating>1</Rating></record>

Only because I couldn‚Äôt give it a 0/5. I have a diagnosed neurological disorder and came to get help for it and was told that it was a psychological disorder, when my medical records we sent prior proved otherwise. As my mother and I were BEGGING Dr. G to help us because I‚Äôve been suffering for a decade with being ill and no help, she walked out of the office. My mother and I decided to leave. Today I received a call from the RUDEST receptionist I have ever spoken to. She told me that I was discharged from the practice for using profanity bc I swore once about how terrible I was dealing with my illness. She then told me that I needed to ‚Äúlearn how to deal with life‚Äù after asking her was it not her job to speak to people respectfully ? She went on to argue with me, speak to me in a snotty, condescending tone and then hung up on me. They would not pick my caps up afterwards. DO NOT GO HERE< /Text>

The ambulance and hospital people who are supposed to care for you can easily take advantage of your vulnerability.

I‚Äôm posting this message because the people who were assigned to help my wife took advantage of her condition to rob me of my belongings.

Here is her experience.

She fell and badly broke my foot and hit her head. The pain was so intense that she was barely conscious. Our daughter called 911 and an ambulance came and took her to Marin General Hospital. Of course they gave her strong painkillers that knocked me out. When she woke up hours later the jewelry that she had been wearing was gone.

For a long time after we pressed the hospital and ambulance company to tell us who was supposed to look after my belongings. We asked them to look at security tapes to see if they could find my jewelry. They were both very unresponsive. The hospital pointed their finger at the ambulance company. The ambulance company blamed the hospital.

So she filed a police report but the officers had no luck with them either. They told her this was an issue that had been going on a long time.

She lost a diamond cross that was expensive and had great sentimental value too since it was my wedding present. It was a unique piece and irreplaceable. Now it‚Äôs gone forever.

Shouldn‚Äôt the Marin General do more to protect its patients? When patients come into the emergency room who is looking after their belongings? Why can‚Äôt security do their job right?

We wanted to share this as a warning. Be careful. It could happen to you too.<//Review><Time>1550633434260</Time>< rate>

Nurse Linda D. of the recovery room was very nice to me and very patient. She did her best to help me feel better after I woke up from anesthesia, as well took the time to call the doctor for further help to minimize side effects. I highly recommend her.</Text>

<review>Brought my husband in to the ER on recent early morning.  The doctors and nurses took wonderful care of him and he was under observation overnight.   We were lucky too, that it was not busy.

What i am concerned with is the cleanliness of the rooms. My husband shared a room with one other, and when they moved the other patient from the room,  the cleaning staff woman, came in and washed the floor -
on that side of the room ...  That was it. besides changing the garbage bags.   The shared sink was never cleaned. The shared toilet never looked at,  No type of cleaning was done, no wipe down or anything. The last patient's toothbrush and comb was left at the sink.
Is that really all that should be done ?   Is that the hospital's policy... ?
I would expect more.
Just saying ...    just asking ....< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

The doctors did not let me know my rights and did not protect me from the older men. There have been a few times that I was misunderstood for being a vegetarian and was served meat with no apologies. I was not treated like a decent human being. at first I was young and on drugs so I was desperate for help. They provided more drugs and medication without getting me to a sober living house. So they miss diagnosed me.
Unfortunately some of the staff is head strong and stings the feelings of kindness becuase it‚Äôs the building they work in and go to monthly not us. They own the rooms and don‚Äôt comfort. Never choose Marin general because the care there is very unprofessional and very much a joke to themselves. I would like the Marin general hospital to get back to me for this review so I get an apologie and know what I said and will help them know just how it should be.

< Review>
I had a friend who was admitted on Christmas eve to the Psychiatric ward with no id or money. At the time the lady that was working "intake" with him couldn't have been nicer. The next day I wanted to drop off a Christmas card for my friend. The big lug who answered the phone in that same department was very hostile and rude. I understand that they must keep patient information confidential but...all I got out of him was, "we have no patients". After asking what seemed like a reasonable question, "what happened to him" (it was Christmas!) all I got was him coming out to the hallway, giving me a dirty and intimidating look and saying, "Any more questions?". - 36 hours later I found out my friend had been transferred to another hospital. - For 36 hours I was shaken up and worried that my friend was dumped on the streets - No compassion from this guy...only ugliness on Christmas<//Review>

<Time>1577407017211< /Time><rate>4</rate><review>Doctors, PT‚Äôs, OT, Radiology Dept. , Nurses and the Staff are EXCELLENT . They all worked so hard and they were really patient centered people. The only problems that I noticed in this hospital is the CAFETERIA! For so many times that I had my meal here , I tried to ignore the flaws that I witnessed. Today I can‚Äôt stand it anymore. Sodexo Healthcare Services should imposed a safety standards in food preparation and cleanliness. It‚Äôs ashamed that all the medical staff here are eating in a manner that they do not have a choice. The Dept. of Health should pay UNANNOUNCED  visit on this place, to check food temperature etc. Check out the ff: pictures

- Pizza is so cold, the heater was off. There is a cheese in this pizza , so imagine how bacteria grew fast here in a cold temperature .

-Salad Bar is unreal. They can‚Äôt even clean and tidy up the salad bar.

-Garbage is sitting on top of the rusted microwave, next to the napkin holder.

-Ice  and water machine is scary, so dirty outside, how much more is the ice inside??

We, the community of Marin comes here to take care of our sick family and friends. Medical staff and employees are  working hard to heal people here , however if the CAFETERIA is not paying attention, I will not be surprised if one day a food borne illness will start from this place.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I'm sure there are kind, hard-working, highly skilled physicians and medical professionals at this hospital. I have been cared for by a number of them. But there are also incompetent, heartless, money-driven individuals there as well.

My labor was completely mishandled, putting me and my child's life at risk. I was offered morphine as a method of pain relief and when I asked if it was harmful to the baby the doctor responded with, "If it did I would lose my license". I guess he should lose his license because that was the beginning of this nightmare. No actually, the beginning was when it was recommended by a hospital staff member that I stay home after my water broke.

Fast forward after 24 hours of labor, no doctor being available to deliver my baby leading to him having to be resuscitated (or maybe that was the morphine). During the following 3 days he was not properly evaluated to see if he could latch and if I was producing enough milk and so he was slowly losing weight but still "within normal limits". We were dismissed but after an awful night of him crying non-stop, shaking and essentially fighting for his life we went back to the hospital to learn that he WASN'T latching properly and I WASN'T producing enough milk. They weighed him before and after a feeding. He had lost 1 lb. since being born 3 days earlier.  SO HE WASN'T WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS but rather borderline high risk. He was monitored for 24 hours while drinking formula and thankfully was gaining weight, healthy and without any brain damage or other permanent consequences.

Well, the hospital decided to charge us the second time we were admitted for essentially doing their job the first time. We disputed our case and called at least once a month to follow-up making sure that they wouldn't send us to collections as written on their invoice. Well 1 year later with dozens of calls to this hospital, they DID send us to collections despite the fact they said they wouldn't and refused to reverse the charges. They did offer us a discount IF WE PAID IN FULL.

SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!! This is not a business of selling cars. HEALTHCARE IS NOT NEGOTIABLE AND ANY ONE WITH COMMON SENSE AND A HEART WOULD NOT TRY TO MAKE A PROFIT FROM THIS SITUATION.

I WILL NEVER GO TO MARIN GENERAL AGAIN. BE CAREFUL IF YOU DO. The person in charge in the financing department, WHICH I WILL REMAIN NAMELESS is not a good person. PERIOD.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80859a0ac1b6f1df:0x8eeb9b4d20a6063f< /Gmap_id><userid>103339253118903330327< /userid><username>Laleh Sotoodeh</username>< pics>

I have been in MGH for pneumonia and following a stroke. I think the nursing staff is outstanding-responsive,quick and kind and the food is great (I can't use the phrase "'hospital food' the same anymore. I am grateful that this is my local hospital and where the ambulance took me‚Äîsurely beats any hospital I've experienced in San Francisco.< /review>

Absolutely the best. ER staff was kind, efficient, knowledgeable and in control of their job.  RN Joe and Dr. Gage-Kim kept me posted on my progress and plan of treatment.  When admitted every staff member was professional and knowledgeable. Have read other negative reviews and just can't see where this is coming from. Would come back to this facility in a heartbeat and I live on Maui so not an easy commute. Thank yoy for your excellent care and compassion.< /Review>

<Review>Excellent, competent, compassionate care!
I was attended to very promptly by a well organized medical team. My questions were answered clearly by a knowledgeable, experienced ER doctor and numerous nurses. They were all busy with many patients, but I was triaged, diagnosed, treated and released in good time. I feel privileged to have access to such expert care.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Time>

I was scheduled @ 11am for radiology appointment. I am waiting till 11;35 and noticed all the people who were scheduled for 11:15 and 11:30 are going in ahead me. I approached one of the front desk staff and asked why am I still waiting? i was scheduled ahead of them. Her response was, because they showed up earlier!!!???

Seriously? if this is the "first come, first serve" establishment, then why we are bothering to make an appointment with a specific TIME?

very unprofessional! Thank you Marin General hospital for one more time bringing us down. You have the worst ER and now you have the worst radiology too. Keep up the good work and keep spending money on renovation!<//Review>

Over 12 days in ICU each and everyone provided excellent care for my husband. They answered all my questions called me at home with updates and refilled my tea whenever needed.

< Review>
The staff seems overworked.  Marin General lost a friend of mine's dentures, when when she was in for a stroke.  Then they avoided our phone inquiries,  and would not reimburse her.  Then when I was a hospital also belongings of mine went missing.  The staff does the best they are able under such low staffing.

A few years back I was bitten by a tick in back part under my arm pit.  I was lucky to see it's hind legs rear end, and wings still sticking out, in a mirror while changing clothes.  Though wasn't able to get the tick out from the back arm pit area.  I go over to Marin General it took them hours to even have a nurse practitioner look at it.  She sort of down played the situation, but told me she could get that out with special tweezers.  However it took them over 3 hours to locate and sterilize available tweezers.  Finally after 5 hours or so, she shows up notifying me they were able to find sanitized tweezers.  By that time the tick had already burrowed in with only a tiny part of a foot hanging out.  So no success it plucking the tick out.  I only give them 2 2/3 stars.  Most of the staff are good people; I must say.< /Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>I've been on the cardio unit on two occasions, the first January 1, 2016, and the second when I was released March 1, 2016. This time I had a bed by the window on the third floor. I liked that very much, for I enjoyed the view, but especially because the natural light helped my spirits greatly!

The nurses were very kind to me, and responded quickly anytime I had a need. I also had questions,and the nurses had to be patient with me on a few occasion: when I was overtired, or even just not feeling well and plainly confused.

The Doctors were just great, and when I had my Stent put in the operation went right first time. Where the procedure took place was a big room, and I was what is called awake throughout even though I couldn't tell very of what was what. So thanks for the skill of the surgeon and the nurses.

I was so glad for the prayers of friends, and Church asking that medical people be guided in their work of healing.

I was also delighted with Marin General Hospital, and its medical people. I was so happy with their care, and their active way of keeping me comforted and comfortable. Thank goodness for their attitude.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have never reviewed a hospital facility, but feel absolutely compelled to for this one. I went into the ER last night and found out I've been fighting a month with pneumonia. I work in EMS, so we don't readily dive into the doctor's office. The staff, from admissions, triage, to the PA and RN who directly took care of me, were absolutely 100% fantastic. All of you were professional, courteous and did your jobs perfectly. To my RN, you asked if I felt any better as I was leaving. Unfortunately, it was 4 o clock in the morning and my body was just wrecked. I told you, meh, not really. Today, I feel 100% better. You're a Rockstar. Thank you and the rest of the staff at Marin Gen for a 5 star experience.

<Text>Went in for a recurring staph infection. Like any general hospital, they were busy and I had to wait. But not very long, and twice, staff approached me and apologized about the wait. The doctor was very knowledgeable, and actually reluctant to prescribe antibiotics, which is a great thing, in my opinion. I appreciated their timely and efficient staff, and the personal care I received, which is rare in this setting.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

My only surgery at this hospital. Never returning. Normally when someone has a huge surgery their brain should be sitting on the chouch doing nothing than just the basics and I did not have that . Last surgery was huger than life itself. so I should not had to almost think for anybody on that nurse floor but myself the best I can in that physical and emotional healing site but no.  I had to deal with stuff I never del with when I had surgeries before.
After my surgery coming in my room was night time by than, I was half asleep what not , I heard a nurse coming in and saying there your her welcome bacthet and papers about your surgery info, I never personally physically saw or hold anything. They should do that next day when the person is awake. 2nd morning I believe guys came in my room ‚Ä™at 5 am‚Ä¨ to put a pull bar over my bed. That is stupid in general. Later on after thinking about it what was the point of having it when because my surgery I should not be weighting anything over 20 lbs plus I only have one good hand. Room didn't have night time light so over nights were hell because that. I got a bed sore on low back , rub burns back of my feet, broken tooth because nobody got me better med for really bad muscle spasms cause of the surgery. The N A acted more like those people from collage that come to hospital for a week to watch. Some nurses didn't know how to put people back on bed like one time they put me on the bed where my head would been almost in the middle of the bed be than ¬†almost walked out of the room.

We were visiting our brother and his husband when my wife had a kidney stone. We traveled 40 minutes to get to this hospital, once we got there they had us sit the waiting room for over an hour and a half while my wife was in excruciating pain. They finally got around to taking a blood and urine sample after which they sent us back to the waiting room- still with no pain medication or mitigation of any kind . After another hour of waiting they took her for the ultrasound at which point she finally passed the kidney stone. At no point did they give her any pain medication. To add insult to injury they billed us $12,000.
Avoid this hospital at all costs!

< Review>
I just had a horrifying experience at this ER, where the care is inconsistent and understaffed
I go much more than average because I have some rather complicated health issues. First off, The triage process makes no sense to me at all. I understand that I will be triaged then called back by other staff for my second assessment. There they may order tests and do EKGs so that by the time a Dr sees you he or she has your test results already. I understand this is done to expedite care and decrease the amount of time that an ER bed is occupied by each patient. I get that.
However I have, at times, felt a bit like a head of cattle being ushered around then sent back to the waiting room. It feels impersonal and the staff in this area are hurried, unconcerned  and not very friendly or professional.
Recently I went in because I was having a terrible medication reaction. My entire body was having tonic-clonic convulsions about  every three to five minutes. I was in great pain and needed something to stop the convulsions. I was soaked with sweat and had trouble catching my breath. When I was sent back out to the waiting room I was told there were 3 patients
ahead of me to go to the back, which was already full. I saw these patients that were ahead of me and none of them appeared to be in any acute distress. That‚Äôs why I say the triage process makes no sense. From my understanding you take the most acute cases back first. What‚Äôs more acute, someone who can sit and play on their phone or someone who is convulsing and unable to walk?
. I felt frightened and helpless, as though I was having a nightmare
The kind of reaction I had was called dystonic and it can sometimes be life threatening. I had the terrible sensation of my throat closing with each convulsion but I was ignored by the triage nurse even though I was begging for help. I finally left and went to another hospital where I was taken straight to the back by their triage nurse.
I‚Äôm a pretty tough person but I must say that the whole experience was shockingly traumatizing. It reminded me of an inner city ER instead of that of one of the richest counties in the country. Next time I am that sick and have no choice but to go to MGH I will call an ambulance. Better yet,  I will just avoid MGH.</Review>

No pt. info update from ER docs and Ortho in computer chart. Ortho never came to give update. Some nurses did not know what was wrong so we had to tell him even tho they are suppose to give report at change of shift to the following nurse that will be taking care of the pt.
Some nurses were okay but overall not a good experience at all.< /text>

< review>
I was here for psychiatric services intermittently from 2008 to 2011. I had a false positive for a mental health issue. No referrals for outpatient was ever made. I was not treated well by the psych unit. With exception, there was a kind nurse in 2008 who even gave me some clothes she was donating anyway to Goodwill. She treated me like a friend. The clinicians were judging me based on my ethnicity and my appearance. The clinicians never asked me which medication I would prefer. I was there for 2 weeks in 2008 for a 51/50.

Even my case manager suggested meeting with me 'alone' as he enunciated. I felt uncomfortable with that. I wanted the case manager who really cares and wanted to go into nursing school to help even at 60 years of life. She also felt the stigma of mental illness. I do not have a mental illness.

I have never been a danger to self or others. I am also a vegetarian and a conscientious objector who served in the military but did not go to bootcamp. I love all life, animals included. I have no intention of harming anyone. I do feel that some providers of mental health need to take this overdiagnosis trend seriously and I do believe in litigation and reporting their professional license to the licensing board. The food was fine at the hospital. There is hummus at the food bar. I do not care for the attitude among the physician residents. They should realize that this is 2016 now and their contribution to medicine is moot in comparison to the biomedical researchers and the biomedical engineers who

I am a google reviewer in the tour guide program. Google invited me to this program because they like my reviews. I am going to review google products before they are available to the public

I think many people graduating medical school in 2016 are extremely average. A friend of mine who is a Harvard Medical School student who graduated from Caltech must be bored out of his mind. Actually medical school students in 2016 are underachievers. So underachievers were judging me.

Can someone stop asking me questions a kindergartener who know. Quit asking me how many quarters are in $1.75 and who the president is and what day is it.

I am actually Danish btw. Can those shrinks quit saying "all over the place" "rambling" etc. The shrinks have ADHD. In Denmark we tell Sagas to get through the long winters

Hey Pam Grimes I was on the path of considering Pharm D or PhD--I guess one of them is pharmaceutical design. Have you ever bothered to know anything at all about your patients. You are just insistent that I was mental. I will prove you wrong. And all of the others, many of them were phonies who had advanced degrees in psychology, which is the biggest joke at UC San Diego.</review>

<text>The laboratory did not send a copy of my test results to my requesting physician. If the result had been abnormal, he would not have been told if I had not involved myself. This is careless and unprofessional.<//text></record>

Nurse neglected to tell me I had to drink liquid contrast stuff 2 hours before appointment
so had to drink it then and wait two hours to get my scan done.
Nurse was unable to connect to a vein and after three tries and three holes in my arms she called in a guy who did it first time.
Power surge during scan meant a long time laying on the contraption.
Finally after 3 hours I was done.......hope I don't have to use this facility again.....</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This is my first time visiting this place for chest and back waxing by  Harrison. Service is amazing and he is so helpful with service and scheduling. Also,  the room is cleaned and has air purifier on with highly UV light sanitizing that make me felling comfortable. Quickly and painless. I recommend for first time comers. I definitely come back to see him again.

< Review>
It was my first time getting a male Brazilian wax couple weeks ago and my experience was great (I apologize for the late review). The man who did it for me was welcoming and talked through the whole wax session so there wasn‚Äôt any awkward silences. He made me feel comfortable and knew what he was doing. There was a complimentary treatment bottle and gave thorough care instructions. Would definitely go back and highly recommend. Men/males don‚Äôt feel embarrassed to get one! :)<//Review>

<Text>First time waxing, I was scared and uncertain.
Very glad I did it!
I looked for someone that specializes in male waxing - rare to find, but turned out to be very important.
Harrison is a true professional, made the whole thing quick and friendly.
I can see how this process could have been much worse with someone else.
I'm definitely going to visit again in the future.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I recieved a Brozillian wax at The Art of Male Waxing. It was quick and painless. I suggest this spot for any LGBTQ person. I been looking for a nice spot since I just moved here from Santa Cruz and this spot is great. It's not the newest place, but the person performIn the wax is well trained! I am very pleased with my wax.</text>

This my first time getting a Brazilian wax and in my head I made it out worst then I thought it would be. He was very quick, no where near as painful as I thought it would be. Talked me through the process and kept my mind at ease. I would strongly recomend him.< /text>

<Text>They had phenomenal service and extremely fast ship times and had my order already to the shipping company within a few hours of placing it. It came neatly packed and organized with great online support for their product which was a rebuild kit for my 6.0s turbo. All the parts felt very high quality which was amazing for the price.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

In a pinch, Empty Pockets Towing was able make an order for push rods.  The procedure was easy, and fast!  This is the second time we used ProSource diesel.  The delivery was fast and the push rods were in perfect condition.  Thank ProSource diesel for coming through again for us.  Eric Fritz</Text>

When it comes to getting parts fast, ProSource diesel is the most impressive company we have  ordered from. Which is saying something in today's world of slow covid shipping times. We ordered parts from a few different companies, and ProSource must have shipped them as soon as I put in the last number on my card. It came three days earlier then predicted. we are definitely impressed</text>

<text>I needed a replacement turbo for my Early 99 powerstroke. Prosource had the best price around.  Called and spoke with Brandon and he was able to answer all my questions. Turbo arrived well packed and quickly.  The sensor block for the EBV delete was not included, but one call and I had it the next day.
Turbo was perfect direct replacement. Spins up fast and has brought we life to my 21 year old truck.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMV9soYA42flJQWaB10eEODY5EkkpdDC9no9cAl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdbpLQEjdqrICZlAi1Zr2epctK91ruFmtqwB1D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

ProSource Diesel has been amazing. I have bought several parts for my ford 7.3. I have contacted them a few few times for questions about parts and orders. They have the best customer service. I am a very happy customer I would definitely recommend them.< /text>

<text>I would not buy from prosource diesel ever again When I purchased my item didn't even have a core charge on their website. 3 days went by they emailed me and said that I needed to pay another $50 for a core charge. So I express my opinion at that point. In the pickle I was in I went ahead and pay the $50. Well at that point I was not informed that it was going to be a another 2 days before my order was shipped because they had to rebuild it here we are 5 days they didn't mail out my product until the following Monday I waited almost 2 weeks for something that should have taken 3 days!!!< /text>< username>

Web site was very easy to navigate. Had several different options for the part I was looking for. Payment part of the site was also very easy to use. Recieved my part a whole day early and was exactly what they described on their site! I will definitely use them for future parts for my 7.3 diesel! Thanks ProSource for such excellent work!!<//Review>

I was very pleased with my experience with ProSource.  The service was very personal, shipping time was fast, and the parts were right on.  Also,  the core return on my HPOP was very easy.  I have no doubt that I'll use them again.  Thank You ProSource Diesel!< /Text>

<review>I needed valve cover gaskets and pigtails for glow plugs. I went to their website and found exactly what I was looking for in a matter of minutes and checked out. Received exactly what I ordered and fast shipping to boot. Very reasonable pricing as well. Super pleased and would highly recommend them for your diesel parts.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>This company assured me over the phone this part would be delivered with 2 day air by Thursday. I never received any shipping information. I called and sent emails. They finally answered the phone the following week. They told me FedEx had lost the shipment. After asking several times they gaveme a tracking number. I asked them to confirm the tracking numbers few minutes later, and they gave me a completely different number. They kept telling me they had shipped all of the ones that came in, including the one I purchased, and it is now out of stock again. They wanted me to wait another 2-3 weeks for the order to be filled. This company will lie to you to get your money, while they do whatever they want. BUYER BEWARE!!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

I ordered a Fuel Shutoff Solenoid for my 1st gen from them and i had an issue with the first one they sent me breaking within a day and i messaged them and they sent me a full replacement free of charge with a gift pack with no problems at all. i will definitely be a customer again, they are a great company will recommend them to anyone with a diesel.</review>

This place stated they had the parts I needed in stock so I placed my $700 order on the 27th of the month on something ‚Äúin stock‚Äù and would ship on Monday. I wait about a week hearing nothing no tracking numbers nothing. I reached out to them they said one part in the kit I ordered was out of stock and said it would be here beginning of the fallowing month. I wait to hear back and nothing once again. I contact them once again come to find out it will now arrive to their facility at the end of the month. They have been changing dates constantly. The parts I ordered were for my work truck so now I have been off for two weeks and still don‚Äôt know when the parts would get here! I will be canceling my order and going somewhere else!<//Text>

Check out was simple. The price was fair. I got what I ordered within the time they said I would. We have a fleet of diesels. We are glad ProSource Diesel is available to help keep us rolling.< /Text>

All the parts where what I needed and the quality was probably better than the factory ones, a lot of attention to deal and the customer service was more than patient and understanding.</Review>

Only reason it‚Äôs not a five star is because there are no color options for the product. The shipping was fast, everything came neatly prepared in the box. Will be putting my new hat on when I work on my truck next!<//text>

<review>Can‚Äôt beat it for the price. Shipping was okay no falt of the company. They had shipped out with tracking number everything is slow now a days. These pipes don‚Äôt come with gaskets so make sure you have some new ones. I hope they hold up as long as the stock ones did. Time will tell.< /review><Response>None<//Response>< Date>

I ordered the Stainless steel Down pipes for my 7.3 project, These pipes Definitely beat the " stock factory" units.

These pipes have an expansion capability,and Much improved sealing over stock unit's, PLUS STAINLESS STEEL.....Who dosent like that..!!!</Review>

<username>Savannah and Dave K.</username><time>1620169822580</time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>Ordered a turbo rebuild kit for a 6.0. The kit was backordered which I didn't know at checkout, but I received an email later letting me know that it was backordered and would ship as soon as possible. When it was in stock, it shipped extremely quickly via Fedex. Every part was packaged extremely well, with the company going so far as to wrap each piece in bubble wrap in individual boxes ensuring no breakage or damage. I also got some cool new coozies so that was a nice surprise. Would definitely order again from the company.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>Good Prices on good parts, have gotten several items from them for my 7.3 and the parts have been correct and fit/function was correct.  Only thing I would like them to add to their shipments would be some instructions for installation on aftermarket parts that are not OEM such as bellowed up pipe kits.<//Review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Good customer service, but the turbo I got wasn't worth the money. It lasted a month before the compressor housing cracked, replaced with my oem then the center section came apart. They were notified about both but the housing wasn't able to be replaced by itself and they shipped me a center section. Second one lasted another two weeks before having issues. Went with a cheap Chinese center section and have not had any issues. Perhaps it was just bad luck but I'll cut my losses. But customer service was good and they returned calls and emails.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I have done a lot of research looking for a good turbo rebuild kit for my 7.3 Excursion.  I finally found ProSourceDiesel and found exactly what I need.  I called and described what was going on with my 300k+ mile Powerstroke, and the gentleman I spoke to was very knowledgeable and helpful.  I purchased the master rebuild kit including the billet compressor wheel.  The price was MUCH lower than other ‚Äúpopular‚Äù brands, but the quality is exceptional.  The kit arrived the next day and includes everything I need for the rebuild.  Everything was packaged very well and was damage-free.  All parts fit perfectly, and my truck now feels and drives better than I can ever remember.  Thanks ProSourceDiesel!<//Text>< pics>

<review>Would not recommend like others have stated they are terrible with returns, ordered a part, customer backed out on job, attempted to return, had an email saying I could return for a full refund was sick with covid for several weeks and could not ship out due to being in a required quarantine. The manager upon receiving the part  emailed me and stated that he could not refund my money at all. After pleading with them the owner offered a 50% refund, which is funny considering they had the unopened part in hand. I offered to even pay credit card fees and have my money refunded minus the fees they still wouldn't budge. I would highly recommend summit or someone else when I explained the covid situation to summit they refunded the parts less the shipping back no problem. I explained this to the manager and he stated that they were not summit and couldn't provide what they do, due to size. I would recommend taking your business elsewhere.< /review>< username>

<text>This is one of the best suppliers. I've ever delt with. They stand behind there products. I had a part that was damaged in shipping. There was no question asked. They even overnighted me a replacement. Also you can call them. With a question and get the answers you need. There's no E mailing back and forth. If you do E mail. They reply right away. I will be buying all the parts. For my 99 f250 from them.</text>< UserId.>

Fast free shipping and the turbo rebuild kit I ordered was great quality as well as exact fit for my truck! Included every necessary gasket, nut, bolt, bearing, and clip that was needed to fully rebuild/ replace the old worn out parts.<//review>

Hadn't heard of the Spoologic brand but had a few good reviews... I took a chance and am impressed so far for the price, we'll see how they hold up! The 1 yr. 48hr warranty from Spoologic is nice as well,  hope I don't have to use it but if so glad it's there! Thanks ProSource!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

First time using this company, this company reminds me of LMR if u know them then u know they set the gold standard about what it means to be knowledgeable and professional, and good shipping times, had to call them about a turbo...they knew everything about what I was asking, I'll be using prosource as my first in parts if I need to purchase online< /Review>

ProDource Diesel has been more than accommodating for me rebuilding my 6.4.  They have great pricing and customer service.  Daniel is one of the best at getting things done.  Thank you for being so professional and getting my parts to me in a timely manner.<//Review>

Excellent customer service. I ordered a part last week it came in a fast timely matter. I had a few questions about install, so I called up the shop and spoke with one of the managers, Bo, he was knowledgeable, professional and answered all of my questions with expertise and to my satisfaction. I received such excellent customer service, that I will now be buying from pro-diesel only. Highly recommended and will be recommending this shop now on to all of my friends family and clients. thanks again guys.< /Text>

Well, I've been shopping around to do some major upgrades and maintenance on my truck. So, like any smart consumer out there, I check various sites for the best price for my buck as well as service and quality of parts. This includes OEM, NON Chinese, and, if need be, as close to OEM as possible. My one big gripe with the company is that their items on "Sale" for Labor Day aren't on sale. That's the normal pricing. I've written to them and have yet to receive a reply.</review>

So i guess i could say i started a movement. I recently bought some parts from from ProSource Diesel. I received a email saying if i left a review then i would get 5% discount. After some time i hadnt received the discount i reached out to Prosource and they explained i shouldnt have received it. They was great about explaining it was a mistake and still gave me 5% and sent me a great hat. Fortunately i havent needed to buy any more parts BUT if i have to i will definitely be ordering parts from ProSource. Great customer service and fast shipping< /text>

Products arrived quickly and well packaged. Was very pleased with quality and fit. Recommend using these folks for your needs. Price is great as well, always a plus.

I recently purchased a alternator wiring harness  for a 95 with a 7.3 l from Pro Source diesel. It fit perfectly, and the wire size was an upgrade from what was previously on it. Highly recommend</review>

Ordered a new turbo for my 7.3 from prosource, it arrived quickly, and was exactly as described. Ive had it on my truck for a few thousand miles now and can tell a difference between the upgraded bearings and compressor wheel, and my old worn out turbo. Id order from them again, good pricing and no issues.<//Text>

Was not 100% confident with picking ProSource for aftermarket parts for my truck. Gave them a shot and glad I did. Everything arrived as pictured and sooner than expected. They did not have the exact part I had ordered some type of glitch with their website I was told but gladly discounted a more expensive replacement no questions asked. I have since been a repeat customer and will continue to buy through them.<//review>

Ordered a block heater cord for powerstroke from their website. As soon as I got it I knew I would not put something of such poor quality on my vehicle. I went to Napa, got part number 28216. Way better! As for this product and company, I don't trust it. After hours of wasting my time they tell me they don't want to return it cause shipping cost was nore than the item. The junk item is $7.48, shipping for me was $9.66. Not to mention their site never even prompted me what shipping cost was going to be before charging me. It just charged $17.14, then in the invoice I saw the shipping cost. These guys gave me the $7.48 back, which I am still waiting for. Other than that they've weaseld out of paying for the shipping, returning the item. It's such junk they don't even want it back. It's still unopened I explained to them, I just received it today, but it's worthless, definitely NEVER going on my vehicle. Worthless, never ordering from this site again. The part at Napa was only $25.46 after tax, in stock. There's only a few trustworthy diesel site now days. Riffraff.com, dieselogic.com, xdp.com, and maybe few others, prosource diesel is definitely not one of them. I even trust amazon more for diesel parts than these jagaloons.< /Text>

The kit came in fast and I was impressed with the quality of the kit. The only issue I had was the factory throttle valve and air intake sensor did not want to stay in place. I fit it using a couple of zip ties.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Don't buy anything from this company. They're return policy is ridiculous,  I purchased a turbo rebuild kit from them and I got the wrong size so I sent it back for a refund and they refused to give me a refund because the box had a little exhaust soot on it.<//text>

These guys ship fast, like crazy fast. I have made two purchases. Both times the parts arrived in two days exactly. The quality of the parts was top notch. The cam  shaft and coolant temp pigtails for my 6.0 powerstroke worked perfectly. Thanks ProSource.< /review>

Called and asked questions about the Garrett turbo for one of my Mercedes Sprinter because the price was below even some turbos that were remanufactured. New! With gaskets! With bypass controller! Free Shipping! And the shipping was within 3 days. Just EXCELLENT!< /Text>

I enjoyed my experience shopping and purchasing parts on ProSource Diesel. They had exactly the parts I needed and shipped them out unbelievably fast. All around easy website to navigate and find what you need quickly. My company will absolutely buy products here for our customers in the future.< /text>

Ordered vain position sensor and 2 days later I received it. Install was super easy. I didn't realize how bad my 2006 LBZ was running what a difference. Slight help in fuel mileage change of performance was impressive.</review>

<Review>Be careful of refund policy. States "at their discretion " they can charge 5 - 10% to return items. Ordered so called right part from description and it ended up being wrong part. Send part back at our expense, was going to reorder another so called right part until they charged us for returning. Ordered elsewhere. Watch and double check refund policy. "at our discretion 5-10%" I guess usually means 10%!!!!!</Review>< Pics>

Product arrived on time and with great packaging. Head studs went in with minimal effort and now have more confidence in my head gasket. This was also the lowest price I found anywhere for Track Tech head studs, just as good as ARP and way cheaper!<//Text>

<Text>Me and my wife were son desperate need in finding someone to give us good information on a part needed for our truck before our camping trip. We had gone through other shops but we‚Äôre not satisfied with the service. We googled and pro source diesel came home and we spoke to a gentlemen named Bo he was not only polite but very helpful with helping us get the right part we needed for our truck as well as answered all the questions we had, since we never have had an issue with the truck . I‚Äôm very please with how Bo helped us out and we would gladly refer this company and mostly him to any other person needing parts. Thank you !!<//Text>< user_id>

<Text>I went to ProSource Diesel on the recommendation of the Late  DieselTechRon and found their products to be quality products at reasonable prices with quick shipping. The Spoologic 5 Ply Silicone CAC cooler boot kit is much thicker then previous other brands which bled oil and popped off at the most in-opportune times.

Great customer service, fast shipping and quality products. My spoologic manifold is a win. It replaced a stock OE manifold and it has worked perfectly. Try these guys out you cannot go wrong.< /Review>

< Review>
PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY!!!! I ordered a part from them, it did arrive quickly so I was happy. Upon opening the bag the sensor was loose in the bag no instructions just one black glove and the sensor. I should have known then it was gonna be an issue. Once the part is installed on my truck it doesn't work. So I call the company expecting the great customer service that was promised per the reviews, well I was helped and told they could refund the part only if I returned it. Great, I thought.I understand that, unfortunately the part was tossed by the mechanic I had no control over this. Still I expected some type of help since I paid out for a product that DID NOT work. The manager raised his voice and said" this is not walmart I can't believe your asking for money go ask your mechanic to pay it" so just so you know the customer service is terrible I have never been talked to like that before, the worst I have ever experienced but also cheap parts that do not work. They get your money and you get a vehicle that is still not running , but now you get the pay out fully for another part that and more repair bills. Just anything would have helped especially in these times peoples jobs have been effected by Covid 19. Shop ANYWHERE else.</Review>

Was recommended prosource diesel by a very reputable diesel mechanic. Ordered the parts I needed. Price wasnt the lowest but wasnt the highest. Part was as described. Good order tracking and fast shipping. Will be keeping a bookmark in my browser to shop ProSource Diesel in the future.<//text>

I bought the spool logic intake boots. They seem like a great boot. The clamps have the sleeve under where it tightens, so it doesn't pinch the boot.< /review>

I was referred to you website by a posting in my mustang 2 group. Asking if i should purchase a very expensive 9 inch rear end for my project car. Was told an 8 inch can handle estimated horsepower but i did not want an open differential. Someone randomly google trac loc for 8‚Äù ford and sent me a screen shot. I was immediately impressed with price vs. other sites.

I read what i could, and was happy you accepted paypal and i ordered unit that night.

In light of the covid hold ups in purchase and shipping, i was not surprised when a customer service Rep called me with the bad news(the next morning) that this product was out if stock.

I was surprised that he had already spoken with supplier and asked them to rush it product to me, and i should receive it in 8-10 business days. He was sincerely apologetic and stood by his word.

I was however surprised when it arrived on my door step in two business days.

I was in no hurry for shipping, but felt like I was treated like a priority.  I have not had my shop install yet.

But would be happy to write another review when installed.

I am inclined to buy another unit for my other Mustang just based on price and customer service.

Thanks again!<//Text>

Bought a EPB delete and turbo rebuild kit, along with an ICP to fix some leaks I had on my 7.3. Ordered and shipped within 24 hours which was really nice, received within the 3-5 day shipping window. Everything was packaged decently and no damage to anything, all parts went onto the truck with zero issues. Only done a few miles so far, but no issues with anything at this time.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x8085133a2a2c3cd9:0x6ce905edaf329d4c< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<time>1588756476003</time><rating>1<//rating><Review>Bought some head studs from prosource diesel. The item arrived quick, but didn't have the required assembly lube. Not a big deal. I emailed them and called them (left a message) and received NO response. It's only a few dollars. They could have refunded a few dollars or just had some sent to me.

I'm not mad about forgetting something small. I'm annoyed about being ignored. It shows they only care when they make a sale. Due to that, I will never do business with this company again.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1589824662192, 'text': "Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

Update: I have since been contacted by Prosource about the issue and therefore have updated the review. Amanda, from customer service has reached out to me and resolved the problem.

Disappointed in the customer service...Ordered a part on a Sunday and was sent an email the next day saying it had shipped.  Come Thursday,  I noticed the FedEx tracking number had not updated besides that the  label had been created. At this point, I called, hoping it was a glitch in FedEx's system. I was told to call back later as the shipment personnel needed to help me. I called back and I was told that they had no idea what was going besides that the part hadn't even made it to their shop yet (understandable, I get shipments get delayed, but why was I just finding this out on Thursday when the part was apparently shipped on Monday??) and that they would return my call later with more details on what happened.  Comes to find out that even though their online inventory stated they had FIFTY in stock, they had none and didn't bother to call me to inform me of the issue/cancel the FedEx shipment nor did they ever return my call until I called back to cancel my order. Frustrated with the lack of communication on the delivery exception, especially after reading all of the great reviews. Any future customer: I would suggest calling to confirm they actually have part in stock, especially if you need it relatively soon.  (Order # 129367)</Text>

<Review>Easy ordering, knowledgeable and honest humans staffing the phone lines, and a great Spoologic product!

We recently purchased a used Ford E-350 Sportsmobile van conversion with a 7.3L Powerstroke engine.  After 138,000 miles, I suppose leaking up-pipes at the turbo inlet "Y" shouldn't be a surprise, as Ford thought they had "a better idea" and replaced the original "International" up-pipes that have bellows in them with ordinary exhaust pipes and donuts - without any good way to accommodate expansion.  (Really, guys?  The pipes get up to 1200¬∞F and you spec.'d no expansion bellows?  Sheesh!)  My old up-pipes had a 1/2-inch long "necked down" area at their turbo ends where the pipes had been sliding back-and-forth about an eighth of an inch in each direction inside of their exhaust donuts, from thermal expansion.  No wonder they leaked!  I finally discovered how serious the exhaust leaks were a few days before our first planned camping trip.  The underside of the doghouse and turbo cover were both black with soot, as both up-pipes were leaking!

We ordered the Spoologic pipe kit from ProSource and had it shipped overnight for a very reasonable price, and I installed it the next evening.  This swap only takes about two hours in an E-350 van, due to the easy access to the rear of the engine from inside the cab.  (They tell me it takes longer and is much more difficult when working solely from underneath an F-series pickup.)  The hardest part is removing/swearing-at/breaking/cutting the frozen OEM bolts that secure the original up-pipes to the turbo inlet "Y".  I snapped the heads off of two of them, and had to swear mightily at the other two before they came out - fighting me all the way.  (Never underestimate the positive emotive power of cussing in the shop.)

Voila! the cab is now noticeably quieter (and "Se√±ora Honeybunny" is much happier).  There's no more soot accumulation on the aluminum-faced insulation underneath the removable "doghouse" (i.e. the engine cover) in the cab, and I'm much less concerned about excessive heat and fire in scary places - like inside the cab.  I can't tell if there's more boost from the turbo without the exhaust leak because Honeybunny hasn't let me drive the van much (it's "hers"), but fixing this leak can only improve the boost - if only by a little bit.

I also added some DEI exhaust wrap to the new 409 Stainless Steel pipes to help muffle the sound and further reduce the radiated/convected heat under the "doghouse".  (See photo.)

The welds are beautiful on these pipes (okay, not Jody or "Instagram" quality, but nice), the fabrication is solid, and everything fit perfectly on the first try.  The bolts and other hardware also seem like quality parts.

I'm really happy with the whole process, and the final results . . . and that's what counts!<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1ejqP-OlFH9-Zz5BpNNAw9VslXZkeVuOcIYg2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

I ordered a turbo actuator from them received it opened the box first thing was theres no instructions like they say so I called they said mail it back for a refund then I get an email saying they wont refund because I covered up there label with the new postage label. In other words there just trying to look for anything to not refund my money. do not take a chance with them....</Review>

Best customer service I've experienced in a long time.
I purchased a rebuild kit for my Gtp38 turbo online from ProSource Diesel. This was the first time ever purchasing something from them.
After watching 3 different YouTube video's on how everything goes together inside that turbo, I still ran into a problem. As I was progressing through the rebuild with the new parts, I was checking to make sure that everything was continuing to spin freely, and it was, until I was installing the compressor wheel. Once the wheel bottomed out, I lost free spin. I tore the turbo apart 5 different times trying to figure out where I went wrong.
I ended up calling ProSource Diesel and talked to Andrew. He walked me through the build making sure I was installing every correctly (which I was), and making sure the parts I had were correct (and they were). During this process we were exchanging pictures of the placement of the turbo parts so their was no question that all the parts were installed correctly. But even with Andrew's help, we couldn't fix the problem.
So, ProSource Diesel is shipping me a new CHRA(which I did not order to begin with). He just asked me to send back mine in exchange so he can figure out exactly what went wrong. At the end of the conversation, I asked him if they had a terminator plug for the EBP delete, because the other place I purchased my delete kit from didn't include it in sale. ProSource Diesel shipped me a terminator plug free of charge.
I will definitely be doing business with them again, especially with customer service that actually cares.
Thanks again ProSource Diesel!</text>

<date>1582761121243<//date><rate>5</rate><text>Ordered a turbo rebuild kit for my 05 ford. Needed to order the compressor back plate housing. Wasn't sure what option would fit. Called customer service and spoke to Bo who helped me find the correct housing. Received a call back  few hours later because I originally ordered the wrong rebuild kit that I already received a day prior. Bo remembered our discussion about my vehicle. They sent out the correct rebuild kit with the housing for me. If they wouldn't have called I would have been more delayed and have to had purchased the correct part and pay overnight shipping again.  You don'tsee companies that care that much about their customers to remember a conversation and call when you made a mistake and ordered the wrong part.  Great customer servicec!!!<//text>< pics>

They worked with me to upgrade to an OEM part after the first part I tried was bad. They applied a credit for the bad part and quickly shipped the new OEM part. Fuel leak fixed! Thank you! I will use them again when I need diesel parts.</review>

<Review>Its nice to see service after the sale is not dead.Im not sure what happen to the other person who gave them one star but theres two sides to every story. I've had the pleasure to deal with Prosource on a couple diffrent occasions and I must say they made a pleasurable experiance out of a not so pleasurable situation.I had some problems with one of my orders Prosource went out of their way to make it right even though it wasnt 100% their fault they took 100% of the cost and responsiblity .It's nice to see there are a few stand up companies left in this quantity not quality internet sales world and Prosource is one of them.not only that but the stuff I bought was quality at a affordable prices so as far as Im concerned  thats all a customer can ask for.
Thankyou, Erika(customer service)

I ordered my EGR valve for my 2010 F-350, and 3 days later it arrived. Next day, it was installed by my shop.  When the shop owner said it must have been expensive, I said it was not.  It was $85.00 less than either of the 2 auto parts stores in our small town!< /text>
