<username>patty Bulena< /username><review>I’m very baffled at the positive reviews of this place. ordered a wrap with grilled chicken, avocado and lettuce today and ended up throwing it away after spending $12 . “Grilled” chicken were small pieces of perhaps warmed chicken that were grilled I’m guessing days before. there were several lumps of avocado, and then tons of lettuce. When I first bit into it I thought I had bit into the paper wrapping. Nope, it was the tortilla that either was stale or over-heated on a grill (my guess was stale), then a large mouthful of lettuce.  When i took it apart to see what was actually inside, it was basically lettuce, tasteless chicken, and avocado. Didn’t even make a good salad. I hope they take the time to go to Grass Valley someday and visit Pine Street Burger. They actually do grill the chicken, nice big juicy strips, right in front of you, with wonderful dressings and a minimum of lettuce. I’ll be going there soon to remind myself what an excellent wrap really tastes like.< /review><gmapID>0x8082d8e8655cb64f:0xcd9abef7a31fecc3<//gmapID><Date>1609908888638</Date>< Rate>

<Review>Ok let's just say the grill area is not commercial grade. It's from Walmart and the area around it's filthy and smelly. The dumpster is like 2 feet away from where they grill a burger gross. And I'm sure that would not pass any sort of health inspection. The person working there was rude to the person in front of me. I will not be back.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXdzRHOD5wvrwsz9qOcqrrzKi2TAFPJ43l34nN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi6w8byryir-WoY65tm_upEv1uBZPQisIpDqi3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Gmap_id>0x8082d8e8655cb64f:0xcd9abef7a31fecc3</Gmap_id><Review>I visited for the first time this last Saturday and I have to say, I was intrigued. The atmosphere is laid back and eclectic, and the staff is friendly. I liked the menu options, perfect selection for breakfast or lunch.

I ordered 4 wraps and a breakfast burrito to go. My brother in law had the monster burrito and he loved it. The rest of the family had wraps. They were nice sized since we ordered a ton of veggies. My complaint? The serving of meat was a little slim. For what you pay for the wrap, you'd expect a bit more meat. And we each ordered cheese, but mine was missing.

Otherwise, I'm looking forward to coming back again. I live on the North side of town, so it's nice to find an easy, quick, and healthy place to eat at.</Review></record></dataset><record>

This is a prime example of never judge a book by its cover. I thought I walked into another hippie vegan juice bar. They do offer non vegan/vegetarian options. In fact they offer build your own burgers and sandwiches. The burger I ordered was vary tasty, and I also tried a rib eye taco. It was vary good as well. Honestly, I'll probably never eat here again, because I don't live in the area, but I do recommend it!< /Text>

The experience at Fresh Twisted Cafe was great! Employees were positive, happy to be there, polite, and helpful in explaining/discussing menu items. The establishment was clean, laid back, and had beautiful artwork. The quality of their smoothies were wonderful; they tasted very fresh (rightfully so), which was a really nice change from most other places which use tons of sugar or concentrates. I would highly recommend them!<//text>

I really love the salads with all of the different toppings, the issue I have is the last 3 times I paid extra for avocado to be added and I didnt get it. They used to have good service but I won’t be back anymore. They also have a rewards program but are not very helpful in getting your points in there system.<//Review>

The people are so friendly and patient. This was my first visit and I was pleasantly surprised of the gluten free options and how carefully they were about preparing our food. There food and the fruit smoothies were delicious. We also tried the gluten free carrot and zucchini bread and a superb vanilla cinnamon dread that was to die for. Recommending 100%< /Text>

Great place for sandwiches and drinks. All organic.  A little pricey but the owner is awesome and works hard.  They recently expanded the place adding couches and TV's. They take credit cards and have a points program too. Check it out if you live in the area. Definitely healthier than most.<//Text>

<Review>I stopped by with my sister who has some dietary restrictions; I had a burger and she had a sandwich with gluten-free options which made this our winning choice for lunch. I really like the "build your own" approach to the meals. Also $10 for a combo, all freshly made is a great price. Definitely recommend a visit here. And a final thought: try the pastries and desserts. There's a wide range of sweets to finish off your savory meal.<//Review>< pictures>

This place is the best! It’s a little ways from the center of town, but well worth the drive. I like to go for breakfast and lunches every now and then, and I’ve never been disappointed. The service is great to top things off. I personally recommend the bagel with pesto cream cheese, egg, avacado, and bacon!< /Review>

Love it! This place actually helped me enjoy drinking kale! I struggle to find a place that has breakfast options for a picky eater like me but I found multiple items that interested me on Fresh Twisted's menu! I also love that they are supporting local artists and giving them a place to display and advertise their art.< /Review>

Family friendly, local, farm to table smoothies, wraps, burgers, ice cream, pastries, and more. The service is friendly, quick, and always welcoming. The food is healthy and good, with vegan options. There's a kid play area with a train table and puzzles on the walls, and kid programs on the TV. Great for a rainy day.<//Text>

Unassuming masterpiece! You'd never know from the outside, and the gas station parking lot location, but these folks are putting out a big selection of food with outstanding quality. You should definitely check it out!< /Text>

<review>The food here is fantastic and the staff is super friendly and personable. They always make it an individual experience here. AND on top of that super accommodating. My friend is dairy free, gluten free, and soy free and they are always willing to make substitutions that you need for diet preferences. This place is #1 in my book. :)</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I'm a vegan so I can't speak to the food. Actually, the juices have kept me satisfied to the point that I don't even know if they offer vegan fair.
Minus one star for putting ice in the juice. Unnecessary.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>I visited today. I brought 1 gallon of apple juice with a taco and island blend juice. I also purchased CBD oil as well.

The person ringing me up was either tried or just bored to pieces. She need to be a little more positive when someone buys a large amount of goods. Nice place work on customer service.< /Text>< user_name>

I have eaten here a few times and the quality of their food is consistently good. I would also describe the food as somewhat filling and large in portions.
Their style of ordering is to order at the register. Either a smoothie or fill out a premade paper for your breakfast burrito, burger, salad, sandwich or quesadilla.
Prices are close to Chipotle Mexican Grill.
I recommend the sandwiches and burritos.
Also the Hulk smoothie. If you ask for it, they will provide samples of their smoothies (tiny plastic cups, like for ketchup).
They do bring you the food, so their is table service.
A little trendy too.</review>

This place used to be good.

I have had two overcooked dryed out non meat burgers in a row.  I gave them that since they used to be so good.  Today however was the third strike.  I ordered a much loved croissant sandwich and it was jusr plain horrible.  How many chances should a place get?  Im really hungry but what i got is tooooo gross tasting to eat.  How did they screw up all the same ingredients on thr same sandwich i have ordederd a dozen times before? This place has become a gamble that I am not willing to waste my money on anymore.
The people are nice but i need to eat... ...< /review>

<text>Let me start by saying, Great staff & Owner. The last few times I went in and got a bowl instead of a wrap they have gotten smaller and not everything I put down that I wanted got put on mostly Avocado. I get it to go so by the time I get back to my office it's to late.

Went and gave fresh and twisted another chance very disappointed, ordered a bowl with chicken, spinach, jalapenos, peppercinis, pickles,  avocado, mustard and mayonnaise ended up with about a cup spinach five or six small pieces of chunked chicken probable not even 1/2oz. more like 1/4oz a couple pickles pieces, 4 or 5 jalapenos,  4 or 5 peppercinis and  6 very thinly sliced pieces of avocado all of the for $10.00. I have no problem with paying a good price for a good product but $10.00 for something that had maybe $1.00 to a $1.25 worth of ingredients. Done will not go back.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

The owner is still a very nice man but unfortunately the food is bland and low quality, and the service has become abrasive and careless. I've had issues the last three times I've gone over the past month and I am finally at a point of no return. The customer service is atrocious and the bratty attitudes of some of the servers are simply intolerable. I am all about supporting local businesses, but I refuse to fund a place that treats people like this and sacrifices quality for cost.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Went there with my daughter and ordered two wraps. My daughter is a vegetarian and did not have a "meat" checked. The cashier said my daughter could have avocado in place of meat, but my daughter didn't want anything in that section either. I told the cashier I would take the avocado (part of the price regardless) in my wrap. He said I already have a meat so couldn't do it. Either way it would have been a wash, customer service apparently doesn't matter. They essentially saved money. Last time I go there to buy their over priced items.<//Review>

They offer vegan and gluten free option for burgers, burritos, wraps, sandwiches, and of course salad.
In addition, they offer lettuce wrap for burger and large satisfying salad.
So I would say it is friendly for ketogenic diet or low Carb diet.
I have gluten intolerance, so it is an awesome experience to be able to order foods like that.
Their gluten free sandwich is delicious.
My husband tried it and couldn't tell it was gluten free.
I love their salad!  You will be surprised their variety of toppings and selection of vegetables. Vegetables are fresh and crispy, cheese was rich and flavorful,  and meat was light and healthy.
They have cold drink such as ice tea, ice coffee, and smoothie. Also, they offer hot drink such as coffee, chai, tea, mocha, and cocoa.
If you do not feel like ordering a drink, they also offer cold water and flavored water for free.
One of favorite things about this place is that there is a nice little kids' space so your little one can have fun while you enjoy your meal or relax with a cup of tea/coffee.</text>

<text>I had:
Cheeseburger and salad meal

The service was great (truly nice and attentive people working there)  and the leomade was delicious! But the burger and salad was very diasapointing. The bun on the burger was burnt and the burger was dry and very small. On top of that the burger was overcooked with a strong seasoning to it (kinda spicy and I didn't particularly like it). I left the restaurant dissapointed and hungry.  I won't be going back anytime soon.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x8082d8e8655cb64f:0xcd9abef7a31fecc3< /gmap_id></record>

Kind smiles and free samples!! That's the kind of place I like to go to, and this place has that and more. I don't know how anyone could be left  unsatisfied (unless you are a grumpy impatient individual) because if you just tell them what's wrong they will fix it!<//text>

I've been doing business with these guys whenever I get in a tire pinch for over 20 years. Amazing prices and great service. My suggestion - Go there. You wont be disappointed.</Review>

I got a nail in my new tire. They were fast and took care of it. They were able to put something into the tire and it held for about a month or two. Something happened to their plug. My tire went flat super fast. About 8 psi per minute. I got my car towed to a different tire shop to see what happened. Sammy's plug failed on 3 month old tires. Because the plug failed, the tire cannot be repaired again. I must get a new tire because of their faulty plug. They do not warranty their own service. I would not go there again.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Very polite and took care of me in a pinch. I got an unexpected nail in my tire on a long drive home and they got me in and out repairing the tire in 15 minutes. Obviously different scenarios will require a longer wait time but they were very careful and productive. Hidden shop in the back that you can miss if driving by too quickly. Will be returning.

Please give a Thumbs up if my review is helpful. Very polite and helped me out in a pinch.  The used tire for my Honda CRV was $20.  The used tire quality was reasonable for 20 bucks.  I would go again.</review>

Don't judge a book by its cover. I've been here several times get to get great prices on used tires and never had any issues. I've come here to get my tires balanced and then for me that balancing wouldn't do any good because I had a bubble in the tire. I found these guys to be honest and hard-working<//review>

Needed a tire mounted. $15 in and out in 15 minutes. 2 younger guys but very professional manner. Used to go to Manteca Tire on Edison but after they ruined my tire last time I won't be going there again. Sammy's is the place. Low prices, good product, excellent service.<//Review>

The tire technician was so helpful, and worked very quick. I had been all over town, and when associates or technicians are rude, I won't stay. Everything was done here with a smile. Thank you, Mr. Tamtin.<//review>

Courteous on the phone and young man tried hard to help me with my questions about getting a tire for a lug nut that needed a key. He was patient and helpful and advised me to bring the car in so he could check. Once I had the car towed to the business, another older gentleman was asked by the tow truck driver if he could drop the car and the older worker basically ignored the tow truck driver. I walked over to the younger guy that I spoke to on the phone and he was extremely nice and said he would help me out when he finished the customer he was with. He was able to help me get the lug nut off and fixed the tire in about 15 minutes. Although one of the workers was rude, I choose to ignore that and give  props to  the one who worked hard at customer service. The tire only cost $40 which was an added bonus</text>

I've been stressing out over the tire I had. With a new family, two kids, and not a lot of money to throw around. I was able to get a used tires that was in great shape, for an awesome price. Also was able to go in on a Sunday morning, which I knew I couldn't do elsewhere. I wasn't even there for more than 10 minutes. Ps, my buddy picked up a used tires over 8 months ago, and commutes. Still has the same tire, and is how I learned of this place. I'll be going back, thanks guys!<//review>

Tuesday I bought a used tire that had 90% of the tread used for $50.00. When I got back to the job site, I put on the tire lowered the jack. I drive in sand a lot, my tires spin very little due to the rear diff lock. But on the first spin the tire came off the rim. I took it back to the shop and noticed that a large part of the tire cane off when putting it on the rim.

Tires are sold as is. In the end I went to costco bought a brand new tire for 87 out the door.< /review>

I took it to les schwab and told me that they couldn't patch it up because it was in an area that they weren't able to fix and that the tire had markings on it that showed that there was a pre-existing hole in it and that Sammy's new it had a hole and was already bad. Never ever will we go to sammys. First time and last time.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>Other than the rude night shift workers who worked here (two Hispanic women who have given me socially distant attitude, like how right??), I I used to like Teaspoon a lot. I’ve been going to teaspoon since undergrad and I have never been disappointed until this location. I’ve called in the past if they have fresh taro and they always said yes, and when I get my order they say they didn’t have taro. Another time I got a Thai tea that wasn’t properly made, there was not enough milk even tho she yelled at me I can’t customize it. Thursday and Saturday nights is specifically when I run into these shift workers so I would avoid it.</review></record>

Tried for the first time! It was a spontaneous visit since we were in the area. All their guidelines with social distancing and keeping everyone safe was phenomenal, they had us wait outside when they were making the drinks. They taste really good too! I got a Caramel one that was on their menu, it’s very milky and I don’t taste much of the tea but the flavor is sweet and still tasty. Their boba is really good too! I had a flavored caramel kind honey boba. They’re sticky and a bit hard to chew but on the lines of boba I’m just thankful they’re not hard in the middle. I’d come back to this place!< /Review>

<Review>Ordered online when we arrived but they didn’t check their online order machine and everyone who went up and ordered received theirs before us. I went up to complain and they promptly prepared our order and gave us a free drink. It compensated for the mistake but I would suggest going up to order as opposed to ordering online if your at the spot already,</Review>< pictures>

Great service, and very safe for those afraid of covid. They’ve got a wide variety of non-caffeinated drinks, non-dairy, and more. It’s more diverse in what it offers than most places. I got the watermelon drink which was light and refreshing!< /text>

<Review>The staff was very friendly. Love it here and is very in line with their other locations. Tried their limited edition lychee rose and was happy with my order Im one of those people who save up all their 250 rewards points and spent it on a holo bamboo bottle.

Teaspoon drinks selection is one of my favorite. My go to drink is taro lover with egg pudding. The drink has actual taro chunks and the egg pudding add a silky texture that is contrasted well with the taro chunks.< /text>

It’s decent, the mango smoothie drink is not good. I don’t recommend it, although I do enjoy the strawberry sangria drink. The boba is sometimes hard and disgusting but otherwise it can be very good.< /Text>

Consistent and tasty! Used to go to other boba spots but ended up giving this a chance when Tpump was closed... never went back to Tpump.

Tea also taste fresh.<//Text>

<review>Drinks are great, but they take too long to prepare. Add a down printer like today, and it will take 45 minutes for your drink to be ready. Perhaps writing the order on paper (the old way) will help to serve your customers better and handle the printer at a later time, during a slow down.< /review>< Pics>

<text>As a self-proclaimed “Thai food fanatic” — I’m not impressed. At all. My family always orders from this place because it’s the only Thai spot in the area full of busy doctors and professionals in a hurry. I plead with them that there are far better options in a city like Los Angeles— having tried almost every Thai spot between Santa Monica and downtown over the years. But we always stick to these guys because it’s close and fast.
To be totally honest, the curry was watery and bland (and a smaller portion than other places) and the noodles flat and lifeless. Most devastatingly, the rice was dry and old— not the glutinous wonder that is supposed to accompany Thai curries. Perhaps try their “chefs specials” if you’re in a pinch— they are a little more interesting.
The service, however, is always consistent— almost redeeming the food. How do you say “mediocre” in Thai?</text>< date>

<Text>Their papaya salad is amazing among many other things on the menu, but I recommend you go for more than just the pad thai because this place is authentic and they serve so many amazing dishes. The food can get a little spicy so if you're tolerance isn't too high, then make sure you tell them to go mild on the spiciness.</Text>< Rating>

Had a hankering for some thai flavors and stolled on to this little eatery.  I ordered the mango pad thai per the recommendation of the menu.  The noodles were very flavorful!  The mango slices were not exactly what I was looking for, as the pad thai was already quite sweet, but the dish was yummy and above average nonetheless!  The restaurant itself is very small and has a couple of seats for outdoor eating.  The server was super nice and let me offered to fill my water bottle instead of getting a glass.  Environmentally concious, love it!</text>

Perhaps the best Thai food I ever had in the U.S. Every dish that we ordered, family style, was cooked and seasoned perfectly. All dishes were perfectly sized and shareable. My favorite dish is the Jade Dry Noodle dish because of the crispy pork, BBQ pork, and duck combination with thin "spinach" noodles (there is no spinach flavor, so don't worry) and a semi-sweet umami sauce. Will come back...often. FYI: parking is difficult.< /Text>

We ordered a lot of food and the portions were large and we were able to finish most of it because it was so good. We got chicken satay, papaya salad, pad thai, fish i think #35 or something, mango sticky rice, and red curry. The pad thai was definitely top 3 best pad thai that I have had. We got medium spiciness level for papaya salad which was a good spice level to still be enjoyable.<//Text>

My favorite place for quality thai food. Don't worry if it's busy, it is worth the wait. Definitely worth going back to. Food is similar to a cafe in Portland I liked.<//review>

Thai restaurants are very easy to judge. You pick a few staple dishes, sample, and judge based on that. Mine are chicken panang, tom kha kai, and pad thai. When I feel like it (which I always do), I get a thai iced tea or thai coffee. Their tom kha kai was arguably one of the best I've had. Panang was off and I didnt sample the pad thai this time around. I would definitely come back though parking is really annoying. But then again, it is in Hollywood.<//text>

First timer today and will definitely come back when I'm near Beverly Hills! So i had surgery today came all the way from Bakersfield ! then was HUNGRY and my boyfriend saw the restaurant when we were driving by. He said hey lets try this place! I went to see reviews because I always do anywhere I eat lol and they gave us a menu and the food sounded delishh! I got the wonton soup and OMG it was sooooo good I can eat it everyday! no fat delicious flavor! I got the pad thai and my bf got the plate! I would suggest getting double protein if you like to eat lol but the portion for plate was good for him. The hot sauce put a kick how I like it! Everything was so yummyy and no bubble guts so thats 5 star for me lol! please swing by and try it out you wont regret it!</review>

I never write google reviews but the food was fantastic! I had the yellow Thai curry to go. It was mild but very flavor full. The customer service was also really good. When l walked in there was a lady having the Green Thai Curry and she was also complimenting the dish. Thanks guys great food!<//review>

I’ve been to this place 3 times. Food is very delicious. Server is nice too.
Pricing is very good too. It’s worth what you pay. The parking is just little hard to park sometimes.
I’ll visit there again.<//text>

I was excited to hear that they opened a hai nan chicken place in the neighborhood. No need to go to Rooster and Rice anymore. Super delicious!

My second time. I had spicy eggplant. Overall:
Staff friendliness  10/10
Quality: 8/10
Flavor-taste:4/10 too greasy no flavor
Portion: 2/10 im starving after

When one orders a dinner they should be full and satisfied.  But im hungry.<//Text>

<text>Overall, good flavor, but the spicy wasn’t spicy. I ordered the pumpkin curry with pork. The pork wasn’t dry and the pumpkin was firm, not mushy. The spicy wasn’t spicy at all, it was what I would consider a mild.

Don’t use all the rice in at once, otherwise, you won’t have enough curry to enjoy and will instead end up with a rice paste.

I would go back in the future.</text><gmap_id>0x80c2b94c1b55f7b1:0x56a68c16f629641b<//gmap_id><UserId.>115444660547528795258<//UserId.><resp>None</resp>< Time>

The chicken was undercooked and the shrimp appetizer was chewy. The thing that they presented inside the egg shell was so bad that we couldn't even finish one. In the main course, the chicken was not cooked in the gravy so these seemed as 2 separate dishes. The main course chicken was also undercooked.<//review>< pics>

<Review>I love Thai Food and Los Angeles is filled with lots of wonderful Thai restaurants; however, Hot Thai is everything I could ask for.. Great food, Great service and Great atmosphere. The owners did a wonderful job putting the menu and place together. The location (Los Angeles and Beverly Hills) is easy to get to and lot's of parking (free valet parking). I hope they'll open one in the South Bay and I'll eat there everyday :)<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Time>

This is just like my grandpa makes. Real, home-style, unimprovably good kao mon gai (Thai chicken with rice). Just get the classic; it's admittedly the only one I've tried, but it's hard to imagine something tasting better than that.</Text>

The Thai food here is really average. It's too bad because it's right near my apartment, but for the price I think they could do better. We ordered Pad Thai and Red Curry Tofu.<//review>

Food is meh. Leaves a bit of chemical aftertaste. Rice is mushy. Isn't like the usual fluffy non-sticky Thai rice. Food is cheap.</Review>

<text>I have been coming here for many years. It's nice to see that they're still open for business during the COVID-19 pandemic. They're currently only doing take-out orders. They have their phone number in very large font on the front of their restaurant. Smart. Just give them a call with your order. Along with your order, they'll just need your name and your phone number. They'll provide you with an estimated time to show up. You can pay when you get there. Once you're there, you'll notice that they've blocked the entrance into the dining area with a couple of tables. They have plenty of signs up with their COVID-19 protocol and also provide hand sanitizer. You'll pay and pick up your food at this table.

As for the food, the quality has remained the same. Everything still tastes great and the food is well arranged. Now we just have to enjoy it at home. They'll provide plenty of chopsticks, napkins, and soy sauce.<//text>< Pictures>

The chicken teriyaki and tempura dinner combo with miso soup and rice were good and had a pretty good sized portion for 18 dollars. The chicken teriyakis had a delicious teriyaki glazed to them and the chicken were not overly grilled. The tempuras were fresh and crispy too.< /review>

Our food from Ninja Sushi was tasty, the employees (when we picked up our order) were friendly & efficient.    The wait was short and our food was well packaged.   Only one criticizm : the rolls were made by an apprentice chef - - all of our rolls were well presented but they each opened up (not tightly bound) but we enjoyed the taste of our super messy pile of food.</Text>

My wife and I tried for the first time and it was very good. It's a very small restaurant with maybe 10 tables. The food was good. I had the teriyaki chicken and beef and it was very good, not overcooked. My wife had the sushi rolls and the fish seemed fresh. We would go again.< /review>

<Review>The place is not that big and not that easy to spot because it's located toward the end of a corner inside a plaza nearby Vons Supermarket. Food taste is good, fresh sushi and friendly customer service. Prices are moderate to high. Pretty fast service.< /Review><rating>4< /rating>< user_name>

Ninja is a small sushi restaurant with a traditional layout.  It's compact and there usually is a small line, which says a lot about the place.  People willing to wait for a tiny spot to sit likely means the food should be good.  The fish quality is not top shelf, but it is still high quality.  Their selection is typical of California Sushi spots and their people are busy with clients and keeping the place moving.  So far, this one is better than others in the area.< /review>

<Text>One of the best sushi places around the area. It's been around for a long time. The place is pretty small so there's usually a wait during weekends and eating hours. The food tastes very good, very fresh and good portions. I've been here many times and the quality is very stable. I knocked 1 star down only for their slow service. The ladies there are very friendly and nice just a bit slow. The parking lot is big so there's usually no issue with parking.<//Text></record>

<text>I really appreciated the staff- after being alerted to my food allergies, they made a fantastic meal for me! The staff is friendly & attentive and the place is very clean.  This place is a hidden gem! Everything is plated beautifully, the Saki is very smooth, and green tea ice cream hits the spot. Would recommend!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Been going there on and off for 10 years or so. The sushi is always really good, quality, taste, presentation. Probably one of the best around. Service has always been good to me. The only drawback is that it's a small place and can get crowded, hard to get a table. Otherwise I highly recommend it.< /Text>

<Text>This place is truly amazing. It's run under Japanese ownership, always has since it opened. I've been going here since 1994, and although the original owner "Terry" sold it in the mid 2000's, it has not changed for the worse.

The food is always fresh and service is always friendly, polite and respectful... just like in Japan.  They greet you with the traditional "You are Honorably welcome" in Japanese.

I personally like Salmon so I order the H&D roll. It's brilliant!  Another good roll is the Crunch Roll.

The prices are fair for the amount of food they serve. The portions are big!

Make sure you order the Deep Fried Green Tea Ice Cream. You can't find it anywhere and it's to die for!!!

Cheers!

<text>We ordered sushi and fried calamari to start. For dinner we had steak teriyaki and salmon teriyaki. We finished the evening with a scoop of green tea ice cream. Everything we ate was prepared very well and the presentation was beautiful. The steak was tender and the salmon juicy. My only observation that caused me a bit of concern was the portion size of the salmon. I thought it was a little on the shy side. If not for that, I would have given them 5 stars.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>First time to visit this place and my family and I loved it! We ordered teriyaki chicken, mixed tempura and tonkatsu. All are delicious and authentic when it comes to taste. In addition, we enjoyed the fried banana with ice cream, creme brulee and miso soup as well.

<text>If you love sashimi, tempura and sushi but do not want to spend lots of $$$$, this is the place.  They may not have fancy dinner ware or expensive decor, but the quality is outstanding. Portions are big, so you don't leave the place feeling still hungry.</text><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

Literally some of the best sushi I've ever had and at very reasonable pricing. There is no fish taste at all as the quality of the fish is superb.</review>

good food as usual. service can be a bit slow when they are busy and overwhelmed but thats ok. the chicken teriyaki is amazing here, still one of the best I've ever had anywhere. Actually grilled (not just seared on a flattop), and sauce is authentic with mirin. Lunch combinations are big in portion and will fill you up for under $10. Great value.<//Review>

Located in the Vons shopping plaza with plenty of free parking . Quality of food and price is great , restaurant itself is small . And you might need to wait for a seat during peak dining hours .<//review>

I was referred to Dr. Winter from my wife after I had sustained a chipped tooth. I was told that she was great with cosmetic dentistry and that her and her entire office staff was extremely friendly. My experience was just that and more! Upon entering, Alicia and Deb at the front desk were super friendly and helpful which is huge to me since dentist visits are not generally my most exciting appointments. I was then escorted back by Kat whom I believe was the dental assistant and she too was very friendly and gave me a tour of the office and introduced me to most of the other staff members that we passed by. Once taken to my chair, Kat helped answer all of my questions and helped me understand what we were doing that day and what to expect. When Dr. Winter came in, she was also very nice and friendly like no other dentist I've gone to. As her and Kat were doing their work, they checked in with me periodically to make sure I was doing fine and I don't think I had ever felt so relaxed during dental work! I almost felt as though I could have dozed off in a good, relaxing way. I was impressed at how well my tooth looked after the appointment and started discussing other dental plans I had considered. After the initial visit, I scheduled my next visit and plan to be a long time patient from here forward! I would definitely advise looking into visiting her practice if you are in the market for a home-base dental office or are just tired of feeling anxious about your current appointments! You won't be disappointment by Dr. Winter and her lovely staff!< /text>

<text>Nicole at Dr. Winter’s office is the best hygienist ever. She’s an absolute pro and I look forward to seeing her! Not only does she do an amazing job cleaning your teeth, she goes above and beyond to make recommendations that help mitigate future issues. She takes such an interest in her patients and I’ve never had anyone care so much about the wellness of my teeth! Always a great experience with Nicole!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dc03fcc841eeab:0x2af9aefa916bfc9b< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had been looking for a new dentist as mine had recently retired. I've had my fair share of dental work and know what I appreciate from a dentist. From the moment I walked in, everyone was extremely friendly and genuinely nice. When I got called back I received a tour of the office while being introduced to everyone that was working. Doctors included! It truly was a great experience and I felt like a valued patient! Feels good to know I found my new dentist.<//text>

Always without a doubt the BEST, most accommodating dental service at Sarah Winter Dental! Every hygienists is so kind, caring, and warm-hearted, and no matter how long it’s been since my last visit, I feel like they always make an effort to make me feel like I am part of the SW Dental family. Sarah of course goes above and beyond to provide personal care, which I find really valuable in a dental provider to ensure feeling like you’re getting cared for based on your personal needs,  and not just rushed in and out of the office.

Can’t say enough great things about every single time I’ve come to Sarah Winter Dental!</Text>

This year for many has been a very trying year to say the least.  I would have to say Meeting Dr. Winter has been by far one of the highlights of this pandemic for me.  I had been suffering from migraines and had no idea they could be caused from my jaw. I was clinching so much at night that I had cracked two teeth!  That’s a lot of pressure.
I was not going out at all since March,  she made me feel so safe. Their safety prodigal is excellent. The office is beautiful and so clean.  Dr. Winter not only cared for my teeth but went above and beyond calling to see if I was doing well.  I would highly recommend her and her staff.  You know when she talks to you that you know she truly cares for her patients. My teeth are fixed, she made me a night guard and my migraines have decreased by 85-90%. I sleep better and I have learn our teeth are so very important to our over all health.  You may think a illness has nothing to do with your teeth but a lot of illness can be caused by things going on in your mouth. I also love that she is a second generation dentist (after her father).</Text>

Very good experience getting a filling:  pre work topical numbing, then painless shot, then painless drilling, then painless putting in the filling, then painless finished.  All time making sure I was comfortable.  Highly recommend.  The dentist and assistant were a good team.
I do recommend.<//Review>

This was my second visit to the office during the pandemic. They have every precaution in place and I felt completely safe. Of course, that’s on top of the usual excellent care I have always received there. The staff are amazing - this has to be the most welcoming  dental practice in the San Diego area!<//Text>

< Review>
Dr. Winter has assembled an amazing team that is tough to beat!  Your visit will begin with a warm, friendly, professional greeting and no-hassle administration by the front office team led by Debi. The offices are comfortable with lots of natural light. It can’t be easy to do during this time of pandemic, but Dr. Winter’s team makes you feel safe, welcome, and cared for.

Next up is your visit with one of their amazing hygienists. My visit was with Alisa, who was pleasant and friendly, and also clearly good at what she does. Her work was efficient, gentle, and thorough. My teeth felt awesome when she was finished!  Like the front-office team, she assured me and made me feel very safe in this pandemic environment. It is clear that this team has invested heavily - time, dollars, and energy - to create the safest environment possible.

Bottom line, this is a professional, top-notch team and office. They make you feel welcome, safe, cared for, and in the best professional hands from the minute you set foot in the office and for as long as you are a patient!  Do yourself a favor and put your dental health in their hands!</Review>

<Text>I highly recommend Dr. Sarah Winter Dental. It had been years since visiting the dentist- so this could’ve been really bad- but Dr. Winter’s team’s clear directions and efficiency made my appointment great! I was a bit nervous and can’t remember the name of the woman who helped me check in, sanitize, and temperature check, and fill out consents-But She was friendly and made me feel comfortable, which is hard during Covid times! Debbie helped me schedule and explained what to expect (Even checked back with me when our call was cut short). Jenn was kind enough to make sure my insurance would cover my appointment beforehand. Nicole was efficient and quick with my new patient x-rays (didn’t even need to leave my chair for them- Bree came in to help Nicole chart my gum health which made this part very quick!). Nicole also walked me through everything she was doing and what I was doing wrong with brushing and flossing. And finally, Dr. Winter examined my teeth, x-rays, and pictures confirming that Nicole had gone over any issues I might be having and if she saw anything troubling (luckily nothing!). She also has a great Instagram account with tips for dental health and great before and after smile makeovers. So happy I was referred to Dr. Sarah Winter!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1611364985044, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review!

Dr. Winter and her star hygienist Nicole always take great care of me. I've got problem teeth, and I feel I get their full attention. Care is very comprehensive. And the covid safety practices appear to be top-notch from check in through procedure. Overall it's a little pricey, but I feel strongly that I get what I pay for - excellence.<//text>

< Review>
Wow!  What a team!  From the moment I walked in the door to the end of my appointment, I knew I was in good hands with professionals that truly care about me and my health.  The front office team is professional, yet very warm and welcoming.  Trina was my hygienist, and she did an amazing job, both thorough and gentle.  Dr. Winter was willing to take the time to explain what she saw in my x-rays and answer any questions I had.  What a great experience all around - I have a new dentist, and you should go see them too!</Review>

<Review>I LOVE everything about this place. Dentists in the past have made me scared to go to the dentist. Dr Winter and Danielle are the sweetest people EVER! They made me feel sooo comfortable & like they knew me forever. They made me feel like they care so much about me and what I want my smile to be. Bree is so knowledgeable & made all my future appointments with what’s convenient for me since I do come from out of town. 1000% worth the drive! I can’t wait to come back.<//Review>< pictures>

Nicole is one of the best dental hygienists I've ever had.  She is very kind, she takes her time and does a very thorough cleaning, and is gentle.  I don't feel like just a job to her.  She's engaging and has an easy laugh and a good listener.  Also the front staff at Sarah Winter Dental is professional, caring and kind.<//review>

Dr. Winter and her staff are amazing! I was so lucky to have her help me and my smile. From cleanings to veneers, her and her team can do it all. She is helping me get my confidence back through my smile and I couldn’t be happier (smiling while I’m writing this). I am constantly recommending her to everyone I meet and would go back to her for work ten times out of ten.  If you want your confident smile back, or want your good smile to be GREAT, call Dr. Winter!< /review>

Yesterday was my first visit with Dr. Winter and  her most excellent dental hygienist and staff.  I was blown away by how great the overall experience was: with full teeth cleaning and detailed and caring check up with Dr. Winter!   I was in the hunt for a new dentist when my prior one moved to Sacramento.  I’ve ended my search and am so completely satisfied I’ve made the right choice,  I’ve already made my next appointment.   Thanks Dr. Winter!!
Remember: be true to your teeth and they won’t be false to you.< /review>

Our experience with Dr. Winter and her entire team was outstanding.  Alisa in particular is such a kind and gentle hygienist who makes us all feel at ease. Dr. Winter is very personable, but more importantly, she keeps herself on the cutting edge of dentistry in order to provide patients with the best care.  Thank you for taking such good care of our family!<//Review>

I went to Sarah Winter dental office for the first time on 3/3/20. It was a wonderful experience from the reception at the front desk, to the amazing hygienist, Trina, to Sarah Winter herself! Trina gave me the best teeth cleaning I have ever had. Dr. Winter was professional, caring, and informative.
I highly recommend this office!

Everyone at Sarah Winter Dental has been wonderful! My husband and I are new patients, and everyone has made us feel welcome and comfortable (in case you’re like me and don’t particularly enjoy the dentist). So far I have worked with Hygienist Nicole and Dr. Souza. Both were very kind with me and were helpful in explaining everything they were looking at as well as tips to improve my dental health. I am grateful to have found Sarah Winter Dental and recommend them to anyone in search of a dentist.< /Text>

Dr. Sarah Winter is one of the finest Dentists I’ve ever met. And I’ve gone to several dentists  through my life.  She’s competent, knowledgeable, extremely skillful and has a great sense about the teeth cosmetics. Her staff, as well as Dr. Winter are efficient and friendly. I recommend her very highly!<//Review>

I have been going to this dentist office for years and a couple years ago I started seeing Sarah Winter. She fixed some aesthetic black pits on my teeth. My teeth are much whiter and the pits are filled, which will help eliminate the creation of a cavity. Recently, they did a full x-ray and scanned my teeth for the invisalign braces to correct a crooked front tooth.
I definitely recommend Sarah Winter and her staff.</text>

<review>I am so grateful to have found Dr. Winter! I had a really bad experience with a prior dentist that kept me from going back to a dentist for 3 years. The moment I walked into Dr. Winter’s office, I knew I was in good, trustworthy hands. She always makes me feel so comfortable every time I’m there. She has great swag bags too... the coco floss is my favorite!  I couldn’t recommend her more, best dental experience ever!< /review>< pictures>

Sarah winter dental is by far the beat dental office I’ve been too. They are so nice and warming. Their office had a nice homey feeling instead of the typical boring dental office. Leah cleaned my teeth. She was great! Very knowledgeable and gave me a bunch of helpful tips. She was also very gentle I didn’t even feel my shots. My teeth and mouth felt so much better afterwards! Definitely have to try Sarah winter for your next cleaning !<//review>

<text>When I moved to San Diego a year ago, I was hesitant about leaving my dentist.Fortunately I was referred to Dr. Sarah Winter! Her entire practice is very well run and I really like the people who work there. Each individual is a consummate professional and they care about the patient as a whole person rather than just another mouth of teeth.</text>< Date>

We switched dentists after hearing lots of wonderful things about Sarah Winter Dental. We were not disappointed. Dr. Winter gave both of my children a very thorough examination and the cleaning was excellent. We are glad we switched.</text>

I wish I could explain how grateful I am to come across Dr Winters Instagram. I had been looking for places to get my teeth worked on for a beautiful smile for my wedding. It was perfect timing finding her beautiful before and after pictures. When I went in for my consultation she did not pressure me but was very informative of the possibilities to a journey of a beautiful smile. I am now absolutely in LOVE with my smile. I feel like I could trust Dr Winter with my life. I am so confident in her work and so thankful I chose her. The most personable dentist you will ever meet! And she has Netflix for your procedure. :)</Review>

Her warm wonderful presence is absolutely heart warming and heart felt! I leave her office feeling so cared for and so very important!</Text>

<text>I am getting Clear Correct Aligners with Dr. Winter and have had the best experience. She is so attentive and always makes me feel comfortable. My teeth are looking amazing and I honestly look forward to coming in to the office and seeing all of the friendly staff members. I used to dread going to the dentist because of a few bad experiences I had in my past. I have very sensitive teeth which typically makes getting my teeth cleaned very uncomfortable. I got my teeth cleaned by Trina and she was so gentle and I have never been so relaxed. Overall I can’t say enough good things about my experience. They care about their patients and it is so refreshing!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Sarah Winter Dental is everything you could ask for in a dentist office and more.  Every part of the experience from scheduling an appointment, the actual procedures, and follow up has been beyond what is expected of a dental office. Everyone in the office treats you like friends and family. I highly recommend. A special thank you to Debi, Leah, and Dr. Winter!<//Text>

<text>Dr. Sarah Winter is the best dentist I have ever been to! Her and her entire staff do an amazing job. I've always dreaded going to the dentist but Dr. Winter and her wonderful team of hygienists and assistants make dental procedures painless and comfortable. When I first arrived at the office, I was greeted by beautiful smiles from the front office staff. After filling out my forms, I was called into the back where I was set me up with a blanket, headphones, and an iPad to watch Netflix. I watched a couple episodes of my favorite show and before I knew it, my procedure was done! I'm so happy that I can finally go to a dentist and have minimal anxiety. I can't recommend this place enough. If you want the highest quality dental experience possible, you have to come to Sarah Winter Dental.</text>< Pics>

Great experience from the moment you walk in. Starting at the reception area where you are greeted with a smile all the way through to the consultation and exam where you are walked through and informed of the entire process. The staff is very friendly and personable. If you are new to the area or just looking for a new dental experience, i highly recommend Sarah Winter. Her and her team helped me have the confidence to smile without reservation.<//review>

I have been visiting Dr. Winter's since she took over my previous dentist's practice a couple of years ago. I needed an exhaustive below--the-gumline cleaning. The hygienist  I regularly see is Nicole, I really appreciate her work, thoroughness, knowledge, and especially her enthusiasm for her work. She did an excellent job for me this time (like always). I was comfortable throughout the procedure, and afterwards as well. I had clear instructions for what to do next, and all the supplies to do it. I highly recommend Dr. Winter's practice!</Review>

<review>Never in my life have I been to a dental visit and looked forward to it. Dr. Winter literally is an outstanding amiable person who is very welcoming and understanding. You can tell a lot about a business owner from the way they treat their employees.This felt more like a family household than an establishment. Talk about "girl power"!

Helping the patient feel at ease is key but making the patient laugh and smile the whole time is perfection. Dr. Winter provides a twist of education from a subtle comedic approach forcing the process to fly by.
Leaving her office having been equipped with this new knowledge and even better smile I am blessed to have gone here. I live all the way in Los Angeles and do not mind the drive because the experience is well worth it<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
I must admit, I’m one of those people who completely avoids dentists... I’m a bit of a scardy cat when it comes to needles or other sharp things poking me. Dentist appointments for me had always been soo uncomfortable and painful that I started avoiding them altogether. If I’m being honest I hadn’t had a teeth cleaning in over 3 years before seeing Dr Winter. I’d say I take pretty good care of my teeth on my own but it’s important to have a professional also take care of them.
I originally was just going to come in to Dr winters office for a whitening, but was talked into a teeth cleaning because it would make the whitening results much brighter. So despite my anxiety of the teeth cleaning I decided to give it a shot. Alisa, one of Dr. Winters assistance was the most gentle and compassion conscious hygienists that’s ever worked on my teeth. Without me even expressing my anxiousness, She rubbed a topical numbing gel all over my gums prior to any sharp objects coming near them. She even applied lip balm to my lips intermittently through the cleaning so that they weren’t getting roughed up in the process, I kid you not this was the most easy breezy teeth cleaning I’ve ever had! And now I’m not afraid to come back for my future visits!!
Now my teeth whitening was also super quick and painless, Cat did such an amazing job of keeping my gums protected from any blanching and we achieved two shades whiter than before!
Might I just add what a beautiful and kind group of intelligent ladies work at her office. 10/10 would recommend</Review>

Dr. Souza and her assistant was awesome with me. They were so paciente and delicate, always making sure I was comfortable. Extra point on the blanket and on the screen I could watch my favorite show!!! Plus also for Dr. Souza that carefully explained what she did on me and also what is recommended for the next appointment.  I feel like I have an one year project on my teeth but everything is being taking care timely according to my budget - followed by my Doctor’s advices and priorities.< /Text>

Sarah Winter Dental is everything excellent dental service should be. From the state of the art facilities and equipment to each staff member this dental practice speaks volumes to the individual needs of the patient.
I'm totally impressed with the level of care, the customer service, and the promotion of overall health that I have received.< /Text>

I moved to the area about 6 months ago and was overdue for dental check up. I loved my old dentist and was nervous about finding a new one. Dr. Winter was recommended to me by a friend and I am pleased to report a 5 star experience. When I arrived, the little bit of dental-anxiety I had was diminished. Dr. Winter's office has a very comfy-cozy waiting area with coffee and tea! I was greeted right away by the friendly staff, this is not the typical lackluster experience I'd expected from a dental office. The hygienist, Nicole, was very gentle and thorough. I felt very comfortable and now my teeth are squeaky clean. Dr. Winter and her staff were friendly and knowledgeable. I feel confident my future visits will be just as easy and comfortable.<//text>

Dr. Winter and her team gave me a great breakdown (that I could understand in non dentist terms) of what was happening in my mouth. They gave me a few options of how I can improve my oral health at home with a few simple suggestions. Dr. Winter also fixed my insecurities about my smile which I am SO grateful for! I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a local family owned dentist.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

As one fairly knowledgeable about dentistry I can endorse Dr. Winter enthusiastically. I'm retired and have had a lot of experience being a dental patient over the years. She uses up-to-date technology and has gentle, skillful technique that makes procedures painless and fast with great results. She's reasonable, personable and she pretends to get my arcane jokes. I think you'll like her.< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I just had my first cleaning at Sarah Winter dental and it was the best dental experience I've ever had. My hygienists name was Trina and she couldn't have been more helpful and caring. The whole time she was very aware of how i was feeling, and made sure I was comfortable the entire time I was there. I feel like this dental office goes above and beyond what you would typically expect from dental care.
I got to see upclose high resolution  photos of my teeth through a small camera linked to a large tv. Very cool!
And also I hadn't gone to the dentist is 7 years.... -_____-
So you can imagine how scared I was!
There was a lot of work to be done!
Sarah winter made my experience feel so much better, and made my treatment plan very clear and straightforward.

(PSA: DONT SKIP THE DENTIST FOR 7 YEARS!)
Dental offices can be intimidating, but when you are in the chair at sarah winter's you can look out at the trees and greenery through the bright windows and feel more at ease. It was actually quite relaxing!

And Scheduling was so easy!
The front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating to my schedule.
I'm very happy that I chose Sarah as my dentist, and I feel super confident about the health of my teeth!< /Review><time>1573189926489</time>< name>

Walking into the future of dentistry! I have never seen such attention to detail, kindness and technology in one office. Sarah Winter's office has happy, smart, receptionists, talented assistants, as well as an 'all star' named Alisa who gently cleans your teeth and tells you about cool new dental products that make your life much easier. So gentle!I  Last but not least, have them give you a warm scented towel after your procedure , and you will think you're in a spa!< /review>

<review>Changing dentists is always stressful.  I have had a lot of wonderful dentistry over the years.   Our dentist, who we loved,  moved  away.  Sarah Winter took over his practice.  WOW!  My first experience was for cleaning with Nicole.  She is so gentle and thorough, best I have had in a long time.  I needed two crowns to replace ones I had for over 40 years (got my money's worth on those).  Dr. Winter is without a doubt the most pain free dentist I have ever met.   She was not happy with the color of the replacement crowns and she had them redone.  They are PERFECT now.  The fit, feel, and look is wonderful.  Have no hesitation; call lovely Liz, she will set you up with an appointment, and the rest of the staff will take care of you like you are family, family you really like!  Welcome to La Jolla Sarah Winter.  We are so glad you are here

2020 update. Another great visit with Nicole our favorite hygienist. Sarah Winter dental is the only place to go</review>< pictures>

I'd moved to Sarah Winter's Dental practice as my lifelong dentist had retired, and she made me feel extremely comfortable during what I'd consider to be a terrifying dental situation.  Like many people, I have a fear of dentists, but when it was all said and done, I'd been made very comfortable, and constantly well informed.

I recently visited Sarah Winter Dental due to suffering from TMJ and terrible headaches. My friend referred me and told me she was great.   Dr. Winter spent so much time with me and gave me a thorough exam.  She reassured me that she could get me out of pain.  And she did.  With a combination of a splint and Botox therapy, I am totally pain free.  I didn't even realize this treatment was available, but Dr. Winter is an expert.  I've had no issues ever since!!!   I am so pleased and highly recommend going to her for all of your dental wellness needs.  Dr. Winter really took her time with me and explained everything warmly and thoroughly.  Beautiful office and friendly staff!</text>

Dr. Winter is everything you should want in a dentist! She treats each individual patient like family, does exceptional dentistry, and goes out of her way to be sure you do not experience pain. I would not recommend going anywhere else!</Text>

<Review>Dr. Sarah Winter is the dream dentist everyone wishes for! I have been a patient of Dr. Winter’s for about 2 years now and she is the best dentist I have ever had! She is incredibly diligent, meticulous, and efficient in her work. I’ve had several cavities filled by her, sometimes multiple per appointment, and never once had ANY soreness afterward, which is unprecedented in my experience (I’ve had a shocking amount of cavities filled in my short lifetime). She’s also taken extra time to clean up additional decay on teeth adjacent to the one being filled, so I know patient health and care is paramount to her.
Additionally, I got 4 porcelain veneers put in by Dr. Winter, and the result was absolute perfection, they are incredibly natural-looking, I could not be more pleased with them! Dr. Winter really does have a very discerning eye and executes her vision impeccably.
Her staff is AMAZING, as well! Liz will never fail to brighten your day with her sweet smile and endearing demeanor, and Danielle, Bre and Cyndee are so attentive and warm, they always put me at ease and make me feel like I’m chatting with friends instead of at a dentist appointment! Thanks so much for everything!< /Review>< response>

Sarah is the best! I was in La Jolla visiting my in-laws and got a terrible toothache...Sarah went above and beyond the call of duty to see me over the weekend and make sure I got the dental treatment I needed. I highly recommend her!</text>

<user_id>115314867060228492726<//user_id><review>The team at Precision Auto Body exceed excellence and professionalism. They took care of all the damages from my accident, communicated with the insurance company and also kept me updated with every initial change.

My Audi A4 looks better than what I expected and I left the shop with the biggest smile. Gabriel and his team did not stop attending my vehicle, literally until I got in.

If you’re looking for a place that will treat your car as their own, talk to Precision and you’ll know instantly that you’ve made the right choice. Thank you once again! 10/10 recommend<//review>< Date>

From the moment I walked in, I felt very comfortable.  Everyone was extremely helpful and courteous.

The work was excellent, and was all up to exact factory standards.
I would highly recommend them to anyone interested in quality work and service.< /text>

<Text>If you ever find yourself in the unfortunate situation of needing car repairs from a collision, THIS IS YOUR PLACE. I hoped to never deal with this, but that’s life. Knowing they specialize in luxury vehicles automatically put me at ease, but after meeting Juan I knew I was at the only place that I could trust with my car. Juan was so kind, thorough, and communicative. He really made this process such a breeze, even with my broken heart over my car getting damaged. He dealt with the insurances and had my car done over a week earlier than what I was originally quoted. Hopefully I never have to go through car repairs again, but if I do it will 1,000% be here.<//Text><Name>Kaitlin Ward</Name>< Time>

<Text>This is the first time I’ve used precision auto body. They were referred to me by Mercedes-Benz of Encino. I’ve been using body shops all my life ...not that I get into a lot of accidents :)  I have to say they are the most professional And do the most outstanding work I’ve ever seen.  I particularly would like to complement Juan Ramirez ...  he kept me in the loop the entire time so I always knew what was going on with my car.  When I got it back, it was in better condition than when I bought it new. They had also detail the car which was just far and above and beyond the call of duty. If anybody out there is looking for a very good body shop, they are number one on my list.  They are also a pleasure to deal with.</Text>< pics>

I would have to say Precision Auto Body  by far has earned a 5 star review.  George was outstanding in constantly keeping me updated  on any issues and progress of our repair.and always courteous   Everyone is very professional and responsive.
From the moment I walked in I had a good feeling just by the clean and organized appearance of the office, waiting area.  A first impression is very important and makes a positive statement.
I couldn't be more pleased on the quality of the workmanship.  You get what you pay for.  Our Maserati was restored to a brand new condition and looks flawless.   You can imagine how distressed I was when I was rear ended at a stop light and we only had 5000 miles on the car.

Thank you Precision,  I would highly recommend anyone that wants a high quality end product utilize your services</review>

Juan and the team were amazing. My brand new Mercedes looks better today than when I took it home from the showroom three months ago. Juan really had to fight with the insurance company which was no easy task and throughout the entire process, he kept me in the loop. I highly recommend Precision Auto Body.< /Text>

I just got my car from Precision Auto Body and it looks like a brand new car. My mechanic Juan Ramirez did a very good job on my car. He is a very very nice person and took care everything that is needed to be done and deal with my auto insurance. Their shop is very nice clean and the staffs are very friendly. Most of their clients have high ends cars. I strongly recommend this shop. Thank you so much Juan for taking care of my car, greatly appreciated.

It is not our fault that you did not read the document that you signed. This is customary in the body shop industry for teardown and storage fees if you do not repair you vehicle in the shop. You signed authorizing that you understood that.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is our top priority and we pride ourselves in honest and quality repairs. You took your vehicle out of another body shop to bring your vehicle to Precision Auto Body. Juan wrote an estimate and negotiated with your insurance. We had our body man take off the bumper and the car was at our shop for 20 days by the time you picked it up. Your insurance had already paid you over $4,000 and you deposited the check. You stated, after Juan had negotiated with the insurance, that the wheel was part of the accident and State Farm did not agree. Because State Farm did not agree, you decided you did not want our shop to fix your vehicle. Juan told you that we would have to charge you the teardown fee and estimating fee, which is on the first page of the agreement you signed. Customers sign in 2 places and initial in 2 places on a 2 page authorization form. The authorization form is always explained as customers sign. Fees don't apply if the vehicle is repaired at our shop. You also received a carbon copy of the paperwork to take home and had 20 days to read the copy of the authorization form. We stored your vehicle for 20 days, our technicians disassembled and reassembled your vehicle and negotiated with your insurance company, all of those actions incur costs and therefore you have to pay for them. There are no hidden fees. All this information was explained to you and you signed an authorization form acknowledging this information."}</response>

Precision Auto Body did an amazing job repairing my auto body damage that was caused by a pretty large boulder hitting my car in Malibu Canyon.

Not only did Precision do an excellent repair on my 550 BMW, but their attention to detail and ability to deal with a very difficult insurance company is uncommon in this industry.   They also prevented the insurer from forcing them to use after market parts and compromise the quality of work.

I recommend them to everyone no matter how small or large the job.</Review>

<Text>Do NOT take your car to this body shop!!
My dealer recommended this body shop after I had an accident, took the car there and was told 3 to 4 weeks for repairs and since we are a certified Porsche repair shop your car would be in original condition.
82 days later and many many emails back & forth I got the car out of their hell hole.
Long story short, the car has never been the same, the windshield they replaced is leaky, the fender is loose and was falling off, some of the paint peeled off, the side sill is loose and missing bolts & nuts....on and on and on.
They totally damaged my car even more and I have hired a lawyer and am taking these people to court.< /Text>< Rating>

<review>I was recently in your body shop and I had the good fortune of meeting with your employee Juan Ramirez. While I am not yet driving a high quality car like the ones you work with, I assure you that when I do I would definitely work with your body shop based on the over the top quality service I received from Mr. Ramirez. Thank you so much.< /review>< Pics>

Wow this place does excellent work!
Lee Brown has many many years in this business and his expert  experience in this industry shows in the work he does!
My car (Mercedes) was hit by 2 other cars at high speed. It was tweaked and pretty messed up.
When I got it back it looked so shiny and actually better than before the collision!
They matched the paint to perfection!
Although a bit pricy It was well worth it!<//review>

<Name>Michael Levy</Name><review>I was involved in a rear-end accident on 5/16/18 and took my car to Precision Auto Body. I was told that the car would be ready on 6/22/18. The original estimate was around 10k but quickly rose after multiple supplements bringing the total cost of repair to around 19k, exceeding the value of the car. I was kept out of the loop and extremely upset that my car was not being totaled. I also had to constinatly call the body shop to check up on my car status.

June 22nd arrived and the car was still weeks away from being ready. Moving into July I was still left without information or a status update for my car. When August arrived and they finally called saying it would be ready in a week on the Friday of 8/10/18. Prior to Friday I called every day to make sure the car would be ready on that day, and they said everything was on schedule.

When Friday finally came, after waiting 3 months, I called and they had said that the car might not be ready. The rental car place closes at 6 and so does the body shop. After getting off work I had to call the body shop multiple times asking them to please tell me if I can come pick up the car because I need to drop off the rental car. They said they would and that the car is ready but they were waiting on payment. At around 5:30 after not hearing anything I called them and they said it was ready they received payment. I am very upset that they had not called me even though I asked them too and they said they would. Not only did they not inform me, they turned their office phone off at around 5:45 even though they close at 6. I was constantly calling them to try and tell them that I was 5 minutes away, but I only got a voicemail box. I finally got a hold of them and went to pick up my car.

After inspecting the car I noticed they had not buffed out a scratch on the side of the car that they said they would take care of, so I had to politely ask them to buff the scratch out. They did and the car looks great and I was finally able to drice my car home after 3 months for a simple rear-end accident with bumper damage.

On my way home I started hearing a grinding and scrapping noise coming from the back left tire. I am now left with a car that I cannot drive because I do not know what the problem is and do not want to damage it further. I also do not have a rental car and no way to get to and from work. I now have to coordinate with Precision Auto Body to come pick up my car, find out what the problem is, and figure out how long this repair will take.

I am extremely dissatisfied, upset, and annoyed with this entire process and situation. The car should have been test driven or something before being discharged. The fact that I had to wait 3 months for my car only to have it towed back because it is not fixed properly is extremely frustrating and I expect more from a body shop of this caliber.

I took my car to this body shop because it was recommended by my BMW dealer and other people because they do a good job. I am extremely dissatisfied with the time taken, the customer support, and repair. I have been extremely patient and respectful through this frustrsting time.

I woud not recommend this body shop to anyone. The turnaround time on my car was ridiculous and the fact that I have to take it back to get fixed is unacceptable. This entire ordeal has been an extremely large inconvenience because now I am unable to proceed with my life. I do not have a car to get to and from work, and now I have a car that is worth less than the amount it costed to repair it.</review></record>

DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE IF YOU GENUINELY CARE ABOUT IT. I took my new camaro ss in there as it got water spotting on half of it while i was in big bear on vacation during winter. When i cam back and saw the awful water spots and quickly started looking for a good shop to take care of them. I was directed to precision auto body via a high end car dealership i purchased another one of my cars from. THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. I took it in trusting them with my car. I ended up spending a few hundred dollars and came back to pick it up. I drove it home and noticed there was some more water spots so i called them up the next day and took it in and they took it in right away to "fix them".. A week later after the car collected dust i decided to give it a wash. I was amazed at what i saw... The water spots were STILL there on the ENTIRE half of the car and not only that but there was deep deep swirling from the "wet sanding" they had preformed. Not only did they burn the paint in one area but they masked it with some sort of black gloss without EVER polishing it. THIS SHOP HAS NO INTEGRITY & ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY. By far the biggest mistake you shall ever make taking your car in to this shop.</review>

RIP OFF -  I waited 4 weeks for them to battle out the repair costs with the insurance company while driving a rental. When the costs were settle it took a week to fix.  They told me the car was going be like there was never an accident.  I expected nothing less for the price they were charging.  I got back a car that I wish my insurance company would have salvaged because they lied about their workmanship.  The car had bubbles and runs in the paint.  The paint was also harsh to the touch and the trunk doesn't close correctly.  So a small rear end collision ended up costing the insurance company $17,000.  No wonder the premiums in Los Angeles are skyrocketing because of thieves like this.< /Text>

<Time>1409252409653< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><text>Long story, but here's the short version.  Front end of my Porsche Cayenne GTS was hit and towed to Precision Auto on May 22 because State Farm recommended them.  Estimated damage was about $11K but some parts needed to be ordered from Germany.  Granted there were a couple of holidays but it took 7 weeks and 1 day to get my car back!  I was constantly following up requesting updates as the original estimate was 3-4 weeks.  Needless to say my car rental coverage was completely exhausted well before the car was fixed.  But, that's not the worst of it.
I received an email from them stating the car would be ready July 7th.  I showed up on the 8th and was shocked to see paint drips and poor masking that hadn't even been cleaned up.  They asked me to give them an hour to buff it all out but I was already late and said I'd be back the next day.  So, the next day I returned my rental in Burbank rode my bike to my office in Studio City and took a cab to Reseda in the afternoon to pick up the car.  The service guy (he's lucky I don't mention his name) was surprised that my car wasn't in the lot and found out his manager instructed the crew to remove and respray the bumper! Nobody had the courtesy to tell me and he wasn't even apologetic about it!!  They drove me up to Enterprise nearby and got me a Mini. After multiple emails from me, they said it would be ready after 4:00 on Friday.  Never a sorry from the manager, never a sorry from the service rep.  So I picked it up Monday because who goes to Reseda on a Friday night.
Sorry, but this story just gets worse.  About a week later I emailed them because the steering felt very loose and there was water inside the light on the side they fixed.  They blamed the steering issue on the Auto Gallery, who they had aligned it but when I told him I didn't think it was an alignment issue they told me to bring it in for the manager to inspect.  I was going to but it was so bad that I decided to take it to the Speed Gallery because they were closer.  Dan (this guy is great) immediately realized there was way too much "play" in the steering where you could move the wheel almost 2 inches before the tires would turn!  He said it wasn't safe to drive so we called State Farm to send an adjuster to meet him.  A couple of days later the adjuster gave Dan the ok to put it on the rack and tear down the suspension to see what the issue was because the adjuster agreed it wasn't safe enough for me to drive all the way out to Precision Auto Body again.  A couple days later Dan called to let me know that Precision did order the right parts but whoever put it back together didn't tighten it all up.  He said it was as if they put everything in place but didn't do the final steps.  Also, the camber was completely off from Porsche specs which would only help to worsen the steering issues.
Would I go back to Precision? Never.  Would I recommend them?  Not if you want things done right and care about your safety.  They get a lot of high end cars in there.  I saw Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, Bentley and Maseratis but cannot imagine this was a one time mistake.  They lacked professionalism and the quality of their work was horrible.  To have to pay someone else to properly fix their mistakes is not right.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29bc3d7373305:0xf223c90ca9b1c14d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Quick service. Good customer service. Make sure you make an appointment ahead of time. It also helps to call and see if they can get you in sooner than your appointment says. I’m really happy about the service I received here.</review>

< Review>
I came here for my SENTRI pass interview.  I am glad I chose this place.  The directions were very clear on how to get here and where to park, as well as where to go.  Everyone was really friendly.  For some reason I was expecting the opposite.  In case you are wondering, there is a restroom here, in the waiting area of the SENTRI enrollment office.  I arrived 15 minutes early, and waited in line for about 10 minutes.  For that reason, I would suggest you arrive at least 15 minutes before your interview time.  The person doing my interview was really cool and nice.  After I was done with the interview, then I had to wait for the cashier.  If you guessed she was really nice, then you were right!</Review>

I found the location easily using the directions from the email but because of the reviews I arrived 30 minutes early thinking I would get in and out. I wasn’t taken for the global entry interview until 30 mins AFTER my scheduled appointment time... which means I waited for an hour. Once I was called back the process only took like 5 minutes. I just wish I was taken back at least when I had my appointment. People that arrived after me were called before me... (maybe they have less employees working global entry interviews than employees for the SENTRI customers??)

Anyways I suggest you get there ON TIME cause theres no point in getting there early and waiting extra time if they don’t take you back early.

My appointment was on a Wednesday at 9:45am so maybe that is a busy time and you shouldn’t schedule around then.< /Review>

<text>Excellent service getting my Global Entry.  I arrived early for my 3:15 PM apt, got checked in within about two minutes.  Waited to be called for maybe 10 minutes (my arrival was at about 2:40 PM).  I was called to the window, and the very nice gentleman asked me a few questions, took, my photo and fingerprints.  I had a slight problem with the fingerprints, since I cannot extend my right pinky, so they adjusted to let me use 3 fingers on my right hand.  I was approved and back in my car and on my way home at 3:10 PM.  Amazing!</text>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service and very friendly attention in person and by phone. They really help you and get you out of business. Almost anyone can apply and have the opportunity to complete the procedure and facilitate border crossing. The appointment system is very punctual and it works. Hopefully this system will be used in other government agencies.

The Margarita sampler was amazing! The presentation was beautiful and the taste of each mini Margarita was on point! We had Tacos, Sushiway roll and also tried the Aguachile shrimp with red sauce 😋 it was spicy and perfect for our pallette.  That was our favorite!  A definite must try in Oxnard! Brian helped us and he was welcoming and friendly. The whole team was awesome.
Great job guys!<//Text><gmap_id>0x80e84d886d38a79f:0x124a9a297b40ac24</gmap_id>< response>

Was excellent! We had their oysters and  they were so good with their own special sauce.  Since we went on a Monday it was buy a Michilada get one free...couldn't ask for anything more.  Their  sushi 🍣 rolls are delicious ! So was the oyster shooter! Nice finishing touch. Will definitely come back to try their tacos!<//Review>

<Text>I’ve had better quality sushi from 7-Eleven. The texture of the fish was mushy and the rice was a bit on the dryer side… Didn’t live up to the hype.<//Text>< Response>

First time and won't be the last time! Loved the service and especially those juicy tacos along side my alcoholic drink, with a side of water of course. One of my favorite places to go when I don't want to go out of town.< /review>

My 2  sisters & sister in law & I had a great time. They decided to give a farewell girls night out before heading back to Illinois.We could not be happier with our amazing server, Jasmine....She was so great, funny, attentive & even willing to take a photo of us upon our request!!!if tou ever go there, please be aware of the at least 60 minute wait time and if possible ask for Jaz(s)mine to serve you!!!!EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!!!  I like my miso soup super hot; mine was lukewarm & they brought it back at the perfect temp...last 3 suggestions: edamame( get the spicy garlic(addicting!!!) Drinks: try the margarita sampler & def the TOXICA...the snapchat sushi was something else(in the best way possible)!!!!</Text>

<text>Reading the reviews I can agree that wait times are excessive, but wait times are long anywhere you go within the city or surrounding cities due to covid-19. We were turned away on a Friday night. As far as our food it was a great Godzilla Roll. And the other I can't remember it's name. The drinks were Cantaritos nothing to be excited about.  I give it a 3 star overall there is definitely room to become a better restaurant and set the standard much higher. Possibly implement and enforce a :90 min rule.<//text>< Pictures>

They've got a great and unique selection of sushi along with delicious tacos and other mexican style food. The La Toxica is definitely big enough to share but just perfect for 1 also. Looking forward to making this a regular spot for date nights and family dinners.<//Text>< pictures>

I'm not a sushi restaurant expert, but my children are and they loved sushiway. I had a campechana w/ a michelada and it was delicious.
Great atmosphere and customer service will definitely have us returning for more.< /text>

It’s a nice hang out, live music, drinking restaurant. We went on a Sunday and were seated instantly, that was awesome. As we walked in there was a trail of red salsa from the front to the patio. No biggie, both my kids orders horchata and one of the two arrived with a dirty chamoy and chile rim. Food was different in an okay way. Kids did not like the teriyaki on the chicken and the rice was not fully cooked so they did not eat it. Husband liked his oysters and rolls. I did not like the Carnitas Ramen, the consistency is like they blended up the pig skin with water. Overall we probably would not return just because on our way out the same salsa trail was there and the dirty cup rim. The overall experience was okay but it seems very unsanitary.< /text>

<Response>None< /Response><review>Worst experience ever
I've never been one to return my food, I've never had something so bad that I had to.  The 20 minute wait to get inside was not a big deal. but it was the 20 minutes of everything else, having to wait, that became a big deal.Basically we were seated and it was like we were forgotten. we sat there for the longest time. we were given one menu to look at between the 2 of us we choose and waited for someone to come and take down what drinks we wanted and our order but nobody came. we waited about 27min before someone finally came and took our order. I ordered the salmon roll and the scallop roll both tasted off possibly old. they were awful and left a nasty taste in my mouth. My son ordered the teriyaki beef bowl. which should have been called the teriyaki rubber band bowl. the meat was tough and rubbery.
I had asked for soy sauce to try and see if it would help with the taste of the rolls. but none was brought to the table. Honestly I shouldn't even have to ask. most Asian restaurants have it at the ready on each table. My son went to the front desk to ask for some but it too never showed so he went to the bar to ask them. he just stood there waiting after they said they would get him some.. he looked over at me and shrugged his shoulders. I waved him back to the table because yep, after about 20 min after my food was delivered his finally showed up.  finally I could get some soy sauce. when they finally brought some over I tried to mask the taste of the sushi with the sauce and well it didn't work. So that was the end of my dinner. I pushed it away. My son asked me to try his because he said it was rubbery. I tried it and yep it was like beef calamari or rubber bands it was tough and chewy. My son loves white rice but he stopped eating and joked about finding the missing soy sauce he tipped his bowl to show me rice swimming in soy sauce. That's  it we we're done. But once again we had to wait and wait and wait. Finally our waiter shows up and asked if we wanted doggy bags. I quietly and politely explained how we felt and how awful the sushi was. he apologized and took the sushi off and handed me a receipt to go pay up front. We go up front wait our turn and hand the woman our bill. She then asked who our waiter was because she can't ring me up. So we had to go back to the table and wait for him to come back and let us pay. The place is ridiculous. No organization  terrible food horrible service. We will never be back. and sorry this is graphic  but about 15-20 after my stomach hurt so bad it was awful and then diarrhea  thank go the store I was at had open bathrooms. never again. and I will definitely be sharing my experience with fiends and coworkers. Horrible. If I could give it a half star I would. one star is too much
P.S We went because we love Chinese food and sushi but it felt more like a Mexican restaurant kind of vibe after we sat down and saw the menu.  What a cluster you know. If Gordon Ramsey saw your place he would say "what the hell are you thinking" I really don't think sushi way is the right name. I love Mexican food too and the music but when I'm sitting in a restaurant called sushi way its kind of weird</review>< user_name>

Previous negative reviews, are oblivious and have no idea what they are truly missing out on!
The staff is very kind and consistently checks up on our table. I highly recommend having Valeria assist you! They have a great selection on cocktails, Rums, shots, and not to mention their Oysters are phenomenal. Definitely I will be returning.< /Text>

The workers were all super nice which I always appreciate good service. The food wasn't very good and extremely over priced for sushi rolls. One roll was $16.00 or more so definitely not worth it especially for a bad roll. I was excited to try it out but I'd say PASS on it.<//Text>

Listen. The prior reviews may be negative due to waiting times however let's be real, wait times due to this pandemic are high (limited outdoor seating) I’m leaving a 5 star because the wait was worth it. Great customer service, great food, & great drinks! I checked in first, wait time was 45 min, picked up a few friends while I received a text message that I was next, and then I received a call that my seats are ready.< /review>

Service from the beginning was super slow wasn't even busy. 10 mins before I even saw a waitress. After being told it would be 20 mins wait after I ordered, I came back in to not be surprised to see anyone for another 10 mins. Dishwasher greeted me as well as the bar tender . still not food ready. Finally got what I thought would have been my complete order to only be surprised that mcdonald's has done better. I wish it could have been better than gas station sushi<//text>

Finally got to go and I regret it my sushi was warm the staff was unprofessional I asked what kind of drinks They had  the waitress needed to go check. The waitress got mad cause she thought we ordered a side of rice but I guess she miss heard us. I had a blonde hair in my spicy tuna roll I was disgusted  and told the waitress she said “oh no ok” and brought another roll I said no thanks cuz by the time she brought the other roll I’ve tried all the other rolls and they were all warm and not good I have never left so much sushi behind or even been served warm sushi this is the first time I’ve been actually seated and order the other 2 times I came they said an hour wait the the hour became 2 hours. If I could give zero stars I would I regret coming. But I know I’m not the only person that feels like this considering they already have 2.5 stars and they just opened.< /Text>

<Review>Waited 65 minutes tonight to try this place. The menu is full of weird combo’s of Mexican and American-Japanese food. Not for me. The one star is for the colder than room temp Miso Soup and old & cold white rice I ordered to eat. Sent it back and ended up having nothing but a glass of water. It’s a hard pass for me. Won’t be back.

EDIT!

My date that night just told me there were bugs frozen in the ice of the drinks! GROSS!!!</Review></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>We visited your location last night 9/10 and we had a very disappointing experience.  We arrived at 630 and asked for a table for 6, we were told the wait would be 1.5 hrs. I looked around and visually gaged the patio area and thought really I don’t see people waiting and it looked like several tables were finishing up so I asked my daughter to just put our name down anyways. In hindsight we should have left. Anyways we stayed and sure enough we where seated in about 15min. Our server came quickly took our drink order and brought out our guacamole appz pretty quickly. We ordered about 11 sushi rolls a burrito and an oyster shooter. About fifteen minutes in we got 2 of our rolls and the burrito. It would be another 15min before we got 1 more roll and the oyster shooter. Another 15min would pass before I asked what was going on with the rest of our rolls. The server was very nice and reassured us that the food was coming but it just wasn’t, he even stated that we were being so patient he himself would have left already and the only reason the guacamole came out quickly was because he put in together himself .Another roll came out shortly after but at this point we had been there for almost 1.5hrs and still waiting on several rolls, some of our party hadn’t even gotten any food at all !! I felt like we didn’t even dine together because we all ate separately. I finally just told the sever to box anything that was left and we paid our tabs, mined you we still waited for our rolls to go for another 15min. We spent over $200 for a really lousy night. On any other given occasion I would have asked for a manager, but I really didn’t want to be that person. To be honest I never even saw anybody walking around that looked like management. I’m currently in a wheelchair do to an accident and this was one of the few times that I’ve been able to go out. I hope your management staff reads this, your server should have communicated what was going on at our table, and the mess happening in your kitchen. I understand that COVID has made things difficult for many and that’s why I choose to dine locally and support a small business but 2hrs on one ticket is outrageous. Your front of the house staff is not the problem it’s your management, kitchen, and lack of communication.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80e84d886d38a79f:0x124a9a297b40ac24<//gmapID></record>

<date>1603344280897< /date><review>Overpriced food and drinks!!!
We got the 5 margarita taster $25 for watered down mini cups of margaritas. The carnitas ramen was soggy noodles with plane boiled eggs it was an insult to ramen. Cheladas were good over priced of course. The birria ramen was decent but would I ever come back or recommend this place...NO. I forgot to mention the waitress was in a mood, everytime we asked for something and politely she would seem itritated and took forever to bring our food on a Wednesday night when it was pretty lonely!
This place will draw a crowd because the food is pretty and people like to post pictures and well there is not much to do in Oxnard. But dont go out of your way. 🤷( again this is my opinion maybe you will have better luck).fyi after spending $140 and eating less then half of this food, we went and got mcdonalds😬< /review></record>

Food was alright and sushi was  overpriced  19 dolllars for a sushi roll jajaa. They need to change the price on the food and the service. Server didnt even know whats on her menu. They need more training.< /Review>

<text>Went on a Sunday night just 2 people so no wait. Service was good checked on us regularly.  Ordered the popcorn shrimp roll,chicken teriyaki and edemame all were delicious and brought out timely drinks did take a bit longer but were worth it Ordered the margarita sampler and michelada. Definitely recommend trying this place out .< /text>< Name>

I went on Thursday and MADE A RESERVATION and was told I never had one but to wait 1 hour. I waited 1 hour.. 7pm came by and they said they were so behind that they were not able to seat us until they took the parties before hand. This place has no management and is not going to last if this continues.  I am not the onlyy one who this has happened too. I'd wish a owner would contact me about this. I wasted my time for to not even a expirence the food. I wouldn't bring anyone here.< /Text>

The staff is very unorganized which is probably why the wait times are ridiculous. Will not be recommending this place or coming back.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service I arrived on Sunday May 16 at 1:55 they took me to the patio 18 minutes passed no one attended to us people arrived and they were served with chips and their drinks it is something very annoying that they ignore one I got up I had to look for the wing that we I stopped by to tell him what happened and I asked to speak to the manager since it is annoying to be ignored, she only told me that it was their mistake since they did not send me the waitress of the area And with a simple I am sorry piece that is the correct thing lousy experience ....

<text>(Translated by Google) Today is Sunday I went with my partner and they sat us down after 20 minutes more people entered and already ordered them, despite that the order of two more tables came out first and the waiter knew that he was seeing us what was happening and just did not give up. What follows is your order, the net is already after 40 minutes after ordering and better give it a really bad feeling but don't mind that happens to us by not first looking at the reviews and comments of others

Hoy es domingo fui con mi pareja y nos sentaron después de 20 minutos entraron más persona y ya aviaos ordenado a pesar de eso salió primer la oden de dos mesas más y el mesero sabía q nos estaba vien lo q estaba pasando y nomás no desia la q sigue es su orden la neta ya avía pasado 40 minutos des pues de ordena y mejor cánsele muy mal pero nimodo eso nos pasa por no mirar primero las reseñas y los comentarios de los demás</text>< Pictures>

Family owned and family related employees. Hometown Ramona Stagecoach Stop originally  as a hitching/watering post prior to the long stretch of roadside backcountry between Ramona...and next gas & convenience store is in Santa Ysabel...and not another until Julian, Valley Center,  or LaJolla Reservation.<//review>

Costco is cool but they don't know how to welcome the customer. Yeah they are at the door but not to say hello or good bye. But more like what's in your cart? Uncomfortable to give your money to the one who doesn't appreciate it.< /review>

You know what you get when you go to Costco. This particular one, on this visit. I got in and out! (Not counting the time I spent messing with the new computers, but that's on me) This one has the food stuffs on the left and back sides of the store, for some reason, that's important to me to know.
The store was very clean! Everyone was nice! And it only took 4 mins to get through the checkout line!
Good job guys! Keep it up!< /text>

This South Sacramento location continues to be my favorite. Easy access from Highway 99. Call me silly however I found it more exciting to shop at Costco than being at the mall LOL.
I personally call it the hundred dollar shop I go in for a bag of bananas and I leave with a basket full of goodies. Amazing variety of all kinds of products,  great prices that comes at Having to buy in bulk.  I wish they would offer an Express checkout.< /Text>

Love this location. Lots of choices. Bought a new printer. Great sales crew, very helpful. I also went to the eye doctor (Shergill Optometry). Excellent care, very thorough and accurate  testing. I wish to give this office a sixth star! Highly recommended and I will be returning in 12 months.</Review>

I just got offended by a guy standing at the entrance for trying to get a mask to wear at Costco at Stockton Blvd. The guy is wearing a black T-shirt, bald and big. I asked him if I could get one for myself but I think he didn't hear it because he's busy chatting with someone he knows and ignored my request. I then trying to get the mask myself but he stopped me and said that I got his mask contaminated by touching it. He immediately throw the mask I'm trying to get into the trash can in a unpolite way. He grabbed me another mask and gave it to me. I don't know how he feels while doing this but I felt offended by his action. I can't believe that this is happening in Costco where I used to shop every month. Costco is a good place to shop at with their affordable price and fresh food but I rated this Costco one star because of this man action.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The worst customer service I have ever seen!
Some other people might have different experience from this store, but I honestly share my experience with a hope to at least help some people don’t fall into the trap they made. I randomly got into this Costco store (I usually go to CalExpo Costco) and purchased some stuff. They said my membership card is disconnected and I need to apply for a new card or they will return my shopping cart IN A VERY RUDE TUNE.  I applied for a new card and a supervisor repeatedly pushed me to apply for a Costco credit card to save for gas and other stuff. Well, I easily denied his request because I didn’t want a hard inquiry to my credit report. The guy said it’s just a soft inquiry and guaranteed by the store. I repeated that I need to finance a car and really don’t want to damage my credit for nothing. LSS, the guy insisted to apply and I did. I didn’t get approved and was told that my income is more than their promotion hahahaha. and they said that there will a hard inquiry to my credit report. When I raised the issue to the store manager, they surprisingly said that I need to call all three credit bureaus to fix the issue hahahaha. So be careful guys.< /text>

Costco in South Sac is one of my weekly shopping destinations for my job, but also for my personal dinner staples.
My job is to supply our care facility with everything to meet the nutritional needs & personal tastes of our 14 residents. Along with the janitorial supplies to make it sparkle, Costco's has the low prices to keep costs on track.
The Kirkland brand laundry soap, Pinesol & Lysol
cleaning solutions are bulk sized essentials that are super - value priced. You won't find these products for a better price anywhere else.
I came in today with my sister-in-law, who picked up her dog's prescription at Costco's pharmacy. The savings were amazing.
While I was there, I had to pick up 2 roasted chickens @ $4.99 each. That will make an easy family meal tonight & leftovers for sandwiches tomorrow. The second chicken, along with dry food  will feed my dog & cat for a week.
We"re done shopping & short lines allowed a quick check out. I used my
Costco Citi- card '3% cash back rewards' certificate to pay for my purchase today.
Now I'll fill my gas tank & earn 5% cash back with my Costco Citi- bank card. Gas is already the lowest price in town.
Wonder why the parking lot is always packed.?...it's simple...
This store is full of
Super Values, everyday.<//review>

Costco seems to be going organic. It's fine if you want to offer the choice but don't take away our non organic items. Not everyone wants to pay more for no reason.< /Text>

<Date>1613055208804< /Date><Text>This location of Costco is a bit farther away than the newer one, but it seems to be less busy early in the day.  I arrived at the end of senior shopping hour and did not have to wait to enter.  The store is clean and spacious, and the staff is efficient.  I took a product from the freezer, and a few minutes later the section had been tidied. Covid precautions are taken with masks and plexiglass.< /Text><user_id>105762174918939775151<//user_id><name>Sandra Lockwood<//name><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>I love Costco. It’s a biweekly tradition to go with my family at this point. I went in for a battery, since I saw they were cheaper than they’re competitors. The auto center employees were extremely rude, almost as if they didn’t wanna be there themselves. I myself just had surgery on my arm, very noticeable. I requested some help with my battery, the auto center employee could care less. If there was a line, it would be understandable. But I was literally the only customer for about a 1/2 hour. Now I see why there was literally no one there. The service was appalling.</text>< rate>

I used to think I loved Costco but reconsidering. This location is soooo terrible. 75% of the store is luxury items. You want pinto beans? NOPE! You want sparkling water in the winter? NOPE! But pick yourself up a TV or a blender and hardly any groceries!!! Skip this and go to the business center. And don't bother with the employees. They're busy facetiming their friends</text>

<review>I bought a pre seasoned standing rib roast. 10.35 lbs and it cost $131.00 for Christmas Dinner.
Looked wonderful and the cooking instructions were perfect in the meat section for med.
It was so over seasoned with pepper.
It was awful!!
All you could taist was pepper and it was so spicy hot.

The female on the left, that checks the receipts was talking to a friend of hers. When I told her I was standing in the other line, because she was talking, she said "That's called helping someone else."
She should pay more attention to her job then talking to friends.</Review>

<Review>Not only do they have the best prices overall, but they price match.

I absolutely love that they take almost everything back at any time (except some electronics after a certain amount of time). Because they back all of their inventory I prefer buying there, often even without comparison shopping.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<text>This is actually 3.5 stars.  It has a pretty good variety although you have to buy in bulk. As a partially disabled person, I appreciate the help I get to the car with my groceries. The helpers are usually friendly with great attitudes. I don't like the way the isles aren't labeled so unless you're very familiar with the store it's hard to know where things are.  The store is pretty big so I do get tired after a while.< /text>< pictures>

We go for the gas! Not as busy as others, and a quick tip: most cars pull in and head towards the pumps on the right, if you head towards to the gas pumps closer to the store it seems to be a bit more quick. You can also pay for gas here if you have a Costco “cash card” (gift card) as well.<//Review>

<pics>None</pics><review>Why does Costco gas prices different at other Costco stores!!? Elk Grove pays almost 11 cents more than other's. If you use Costco on Sunrise blvd it's 22 cents more there. I travel to Vallejo it's almost 15 cents cheaper. So much for membership cost.</review><userid>114903230120361066321</userid>< Name>

< review>
Saw staff members laughing and taking photos of an Asian elderly wearing a plastic container as a mask. Couldn’t see their name tags because their phones were covering it. It was a white woman and person of color male. Afterwards I went into checkout and the lady checking me out completely ignored me after I asked to preorder food. I had to ask her twice before she said “It’s too late your receipt already printed”. It’s a shame majority of the staff are something else but the other half are lovely. 3 stars because I’ve been coming here for a long time and I do enjoy shopping here but the staff should be trained a little better.</review>

There's something about going to a store where people take pride in there work and are happy to be there. This isn't one of those stores. If you don't want to do your job, or want to pick and choose who you respect. Go the f--- away! If you don't like going to work so bad that you treat the public negatively, stay home.</Review>

It is a nice large place, a lot of parking space. It is an older store so it can feel smaller than others. It has plenty of Asian items which makes it stand out from others. Staff is good to help you as needed.<//review>

My favorite Costco Warehouse.
It has everything I need :  Gas Station; Tire and Battery Center;
and I enjoy their clean, cool indoor seating area ( food court )  to enjoy my lunch. The most courteous employees 😊< /review>

<Text>Produce is always on it's last day. They didn't have 3 of the items I went in for (Not uncommon). No ready roasted chickens. I asked myself why I renewed my membership. I also went to the eyeglass department and wasn't helped as soon as I should have because I wasn't standing in the right DOT. What the hell is that?! Another disappointing visit and I like to And prefer giving GOOD reviews. Not today!</Text>< pics>

I am disappointed in COSTCO because everytime I think I am going to be able to get my vitamins from them the second or third time in a row they change what they are having in stocks!!! You never can depend on them to have the same items all the time it's always different items !!!< /Text>

<text>Costco needs to set limits on some the high demand items so they can keep in stock longer. I am a massage therapist and like using wipes to sanitize my table after a massage but everytime i try buing a larger quantity from costco they are always out of stock so i end up buying a lot of smaller packages just to limit the trips to a store. I would like to keep supplies on a monthly basis opposed to needing to go buy them weekly<//text><gmapID>0x809ac5c4f27885f5:0xbe295071682a2605< /gmapID>< user>

it's cool. Is by far my favorite Costco mostly because of convenience however I will say they do not have as much as some of the other Costco's and tend to run out very quickly!<//review>

<review>Visited here many times always have new products and great discounts. I buy most of my groceries here and always end up buying more than I planned. Staff is great, checkers are fast and friendly, at the exit they always draw smile face for my kids. Don’t worry about long lines because they are so fast! I was just there for return and lines were long but I can’t believe how fast they processed I had to wait only 4 to 5 minutes that’s unbelievable!
Definitely recommending this store to friends, family and everyone!<//review>< pics>

<text>Horrible.  Full of people who bring their families and just sit around at free sample areas.  Then being completely oblivious to the fact that they are blocking the whole lane with their cart and their annoying family.  Bring music or some other stress reliever because this place is a hell hole.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOMwmcf-TG8f88bDPVo3JdV4cS9T6ETnmIGgYz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

<review>Great location, friendly staff, well stocked warehouse...what more could I ask for?  I entered the warehouse about 10 minutes before closing but was able to find everything I wanted and check out before it closed.  =)  I also like getting my gas here and appreciate the rebate at the end of the year.<//review><userid>110450211945161967118</userid>< rating>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>The item selection at this Costco is excellent. The employees are friendly and helpful. The customers however, are not so nice. I have been here twice pre-covid19 and three times during covid19, and each time, the customers are inconsiderate, rude, loud, and just awful. Stopping abruptly and blocking entire rows seems to be a fun game people play here, so go to another Costco location unless you want to spend a frustrating two hours trying to circumnavigate the store.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Returns... If you have to make a return it's easy.
Costumer service... is excellent anywhere is the store.
Samples... are done through out the day. It's my understanding that lose money on samples, samples are for consumer enjoyment.
Food Court... Low cost and good quality food. They must break even on the food court, they can't possibly make money there.
Atmosphere... Because of the membership, the shoppers tend to be respectful and usually kind.
Photo Center... Is wonderful, awesome personal gift opportunity and personal home decor. Speedy service.</review><pics>None< /pics><rate>5< /rate>< GmapID>

Shopping at costco is amazing. They have a bunch of different products, everything they sell is of course different but you can really get away with ordering things online. I've been to their stores and they're all great places to go for the prices you can't find from anywhere else. Just be prepared to spend your hard earned money.</review>

< review>
Costco is a store that offers well known brand products and their brand merchandise, Kirkland.  Cannot beat their food court prices:  Price of a whole pizza NEVER has increased!  The other day,  a older fellow carried four whole pizzas away!  They are YUMMY too.

Return policies are outstanding.  Can return item to a different store, and at times without a receipt because only Costco sells Kirkland brands.

Once in Taiwan, we found a Costco!  Food court offered different foods.  Thoroughly a treat!
Cannot help but love Costco!</review>

<Text>This is a very popular store in the area. Yes, almost always it is overcrowded which means it is popular.
In addition to the common for all Costco stores products they offer halal food.
Their gas is the cheapest in great Sacramento area. This is why there always are many cars at their big and comfortable gas station.
Pretty often it is very hard to find parking spot near the store although the parking lot is very big.</Text></record>

I did not enjoy their new food court. So their food court has a card table if you're paying with card and cash is upfront.  I called ahead of time for pizza and I waited way to long just to pick it up. There is no line, there is just a bunched up people waiting for their food. When people walk in like myself and others who paid at the other registers. We can no clue what is happening. I had other customers ask me how to order, where do I pay with card, is this the line? The employees at the food court in behind the counter seemed very disorganized that's why it took me forever to even get my pizza. I can't for a split second get their attention because they're so busy calling orders out. I feel like the old format where there is line for those who wanted to order food and another line for pick up is way better and easier to understand. Costco, the old format is better to be honest.<//review>

This is my go to place for purchasing bottled water and Gatorades at a great price. Good location of the store with plenty of parking (its a busy store so you’ll most likely have to park a bit far). As any other Costco, their food court is good and you can never go wrong with a delicious non-fat swirl yogurt (only $1.35!). As I mentioned earlier, it’s a busy store so make sure to always pre-order your whole pizza(s). I also get a lot of photos printed here and the photo staff is always very friendly and professional 👍🏼. Actually, i don’t think I’ve ever encountered a rude Costco employee (knock on wood). The only thing Costco needs is an express lane! Its irritating having less than 5 items and waiting behind customers with loaded carts 😒. Other than that, Costco is the best! 🙌🏼<//review>

< Review>
I purchased tires and the staff worked efficiently through the purchase including explaining the special offers up front and then serviced my car. They were really polite. I would also say that they work well between stores. I started out at Elk Grove and they said not have the inventory but took the time to find which other location did. They sent me with a print out of the info so I did not have to start all over at the next location. Much appreciated. Very competitive pricing and warranty.</Review>

They were really polite. I would also say that they work well between stores. I started out at Elk Grove and they said not have the inventory but took the time to find which other location did. They sent me with a print out of the info so I did not have to start all over at the next location. Much appreciated. Very competitive pricing and warranty.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>Costco is using Expressit Logistics based in Rocklin, CA for their deliveries and these people have years long track record of scamming and fraudulence. These people lied about having delivered a package worth $600 that I never received. Check their Yelp reviews for more instances of this. I am extremely disappointed that Costco is using Expressit Logistics for their deliveries, as we will now be purchasing that item from someone else due to this.

Avoid Expressit Logistics at all costs, as they are probably keeping items for themselves and selling them on the side.<//text>< pics>

<text>Store number 25. A delight to shop for the things you need. Lots of tasting stations to assist in dinner selections. If you see something you want or need, get it. If you wait you may be out of luck at a later date. Items move fast. Don't forget that the Kirkland brand is made by the same companies you love but without the expensive titke/name.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
It's Costco. Very busy even on the weekdays. Has a good selection of items and friendly staff. Could use a better selection of some products like soda. Good deli section. Pushy sales reps at the home improvement alley. Just steer clear of them and you'll be just fine.</Review>

We love to get a slice of pizza and a hot dog after shopping. If you go around 3pm it's not too crowded. We Also got our dental insurance with Costco and rented a car.</Review>< Pictures>

DO NOT BUY YOUR GLASSES HERE or maybe any of them (same lab)
Ordered glasses and the lab screwed up the prescription.  returned them and Still they can't get it right. Rethink if your wanting to use them to get your glasses.
Cheaper means just that I guess. kinda sad. I use to love costco.</text>

Love shopping here they a huge variety of items in bulk. The samples are always nice and the quality of the food is great, their rotisserie chicken is delicious and only 5$ The food in the foodcourt is very reasonably priced and a great deal for what you can get.<//Text>

It’s my local costco, everything in the store are in high quality. Also we can get a good promotions in different time on a year such as amazing holiday season offers clothes, gifts packages, pajamas, chocolates, perfumes, etc.
The store also has photo center that can help people to get their photographs in 30-60 min every day. Cashiers are really helpful and friendly.<//text>

You can find pretty much anything in this neighborhood store at a cheaper price then let's say Safeway. Even though the store is further out from the Sacramento metropolitan area this is what you may need a car to haul groceries with because they do sell items in bulk, it's still worth the price and location.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I was very disappointed in the staff. I couldn't use my membership card because they claimed I had written a bad check  17 yrs ago. They were not accommodating at all I had to ask somebody behind me to help me with their membership so I can purchase my items I don't understand how I got a membership if I had a bad check from 17 years ago they will not let me use my membership still and this is very annoying inferi infuriating<//Text>

<review>Few options among similar products, but they usually pick quality products. I've used some of their outdoor clothing and equipment in overnight snowstorms in the mountains. Works just as well as name brands.

Lots of parking available, as usual.  Staff there was very helpful.  Store was in the process of moving things around, but it did not effect shopping.  Clean, wide, well lit aisles.  Registers were well staffed and we got in and out quickly!<//review>

We strictly go for the food court since we aren't members and all...but I can say the hot dog and pizza deals cannot be beat. Sometimes the lines are long and the parking can be fierce but it's well worth it</Review>

<Review>I love Costco they all have there own unique vibe none of them are cookie cutter. The new one in Elk Grove has new items in food court for instance. Also the Elk Grove location is not packed although usually it is out of the e shopping carts so far so that's a big negative hopefully they will get a couple more machines</Review>< Pics>

<review>Amazing store to get groceries, good quality service and treats you well. A lot of different choices for fruits, veggies and snacks. Different variety of drinks to buy. Overall a good place to shop, and I would recommend for people to go to Costco. The food court is great, good prices for good quality food. I would recommend the salad, it’s delicious.< /review>< userid>

<Review>This is just like almost any other Costco enormous lines inside cheap lunch options. Fun samples. And I never get out the door without spending $100. There is one difference to this Costco though they redid the gas station and it runs a lot quicker and smoother. Line still gather but they move a lot faster.< /Review>< Date>

<text>I have been a member of Costco for years when it used to be Price club. It is a great place to shop. It is Well organized and the most important thing for a big Warehouse is that their staff is very helpful and also knowledgeable. Even though you're dealing with crowds it is to okay to maneuver and pay for your stuff. I do wish that Costco would introduce the self-pay on your phone as Sam. I do not buy a whole lot of stuff it is normally 4 or 5 items and paying on your phone would be a great advantage. In the end of September they are going to be opening on you Costco store less than a mile from my home email to girlfriend I will definitely go and Shop there more and utilize their gas< /text>< rating>

<rating>5< /rating><review>One of my favorite places to shop. Great prices for clothing, food and liquor. Bought my vacuum, garage door and flooring there the only big disappointment was their solar contractor . The representative was uninformed, rude and then we were denied service for nonexisting dry rot. We had it checked just in case. They also tried to cut Costco out of the deal. Only negative aspect I have ever encountered at Costco.</review>< Pictures>

What's left to say? Costco has almost everything you will ever need at good prices. Usually crowded. I found best time to shop is Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday between 2:30 & 4:00 PM. New Costco opening in nearby Elk Grove (Elk Grove Blvd & Franklin) later this year.< /Text>

I like the Costco stores, this is nearest to my place. The staff and the management are doing a very good job. They take care of the costumers very well. No doubt some times it gets busy but still the staff do their best to get the things going. Keep it up.< /text>

Great place to shop. Some don't want to pay the membership fee, I've been a member for 25 yrs and have gotten back double in savings.  I also buy Costco Kirkland brands, as good as the name brands but cheaper in price, never to disappoint. Costco is so popular, if you time it just right you can avoid the crowds and long check out lines. It will be so wonderful when the new store opens in Elk Grove.<//text>

Overcrowded!! It is not possible to enjoy shopping here. I bought a executive membership because everyone told me it's better than Sam's club. I beg to differ. I did enjoy their food court.</review>

This is just like almost any other Costco enormous lines inside cheap lunch options. Fun samples. And I never get out the door without spending $100. There is one difference to this Costco though they redid the gas station and it runs a lot quicker and smoother. Line still gather but they move a lot faster.</Review>

Great to walk around and check for deals. But always remember costco is not always the best deal.
Even when it's on sale it can be cheaper to goto a regular store.

Always try to avoid crowds especially if you have refrigerated/frozen on warm/hot days.< /Review>

<Review>Went to Costco to purchase a necklace for Christmas, and to my surprise I got a $75 discount because it was Christmas or I was using my business account and I was very happy and I hope the person likes it as much as I'm looking at it and I'll give the whole experience 10 Stars if it wasn't for the crazy lines that were in Costco.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbSPpm76zqtkIAXz5C9LifgRYHIhiYLt3zpWd7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

COSTCO had a great sale on Oral N toothbrushes. I really like how the sale items were on the first aisle as you entered the store. While the check out lines seemed long the store had most of the checkouts opened.
My line moved very fast. COSTCO parking is always a challenge but the experience went smoothly today.<//text>

<Review>Costco is always cool as far as friendly service is concerned,  but there's NEVER any parking!  It's ALWAYS full and they never have the little buggy carts for my grandma.  I think they own 2 or 3 electronic carts and when I asked about why they didn't invest in more,  I was told Costco didn't have the profit to buy more carts... Hmmm. I mean,  tell me anything but that.  They're building a new one off of elk Grove Blvd,  so I'm like,  you can build another store,  but you can't buy 2 more electronic buggies? There are a lot of older people who shop here. Plus,  Sam's Club down the street ALWAYS has a cart for my grandma. And they have about 8-10 electronic carts total,  so it never seems to be an issue when we go there.
Anyway,  only 2 complaints about Costco.  And it's not just this ONE Costco where this is an issue.  We run into the same exact problem at the other 2 in Sacramento.  They also only have 2 MAYBE 3 electronic carts total and almost never have any available when I take my grandma.  So we end up going to Sam's Club for that sole reason.
Costco is losing a lot of business because they don't seem to be elderly or disabled friendly.  If they invested is some more carts,  they'd probably actually make more money.<//Review>< GmapID>

<review>I received the best service today. Today my 16 month old baby flipped out of the basket at the check out and hit his head on the ground and started bleeding out of his mouth. One of the girl workers quickly came and brought me paper towels, ice, and ice packs and a few other employees quickly came to assist me. They called the paramedics and they arrived very quickly.  I am so grateful for the staff helping me . The manager was also there helping out too. What a great team. I appreciate you all</review>< gmapID>

optical department very reasonably priced I got a set of sunglasses and a set of regular everyday glasses and they seem to be cut totally different they did a good job on the sunglasses but I can't see anything. The lenses are progressive bifocal and I can't find the second lens in my right lens. And the lenses are really thick. Going back to eye doctor to make sure they followed the prescription. Never had this experience with glasses before<//Review>

Probably one of the busiest stores I've ever seen this side of the Bay Area. Sort of feels like a 3rd world.  If you plan on going to this store, pack a lunch or go get a hot dog. Also wear good shoes because you're going to need to park far away. Other than that, the store was clean the people were nice< /Text>

I love Costco! I love to shop at Costco! I love to just walk around and look all of the stuff at Costco. This location tends to be a little more crowded because the building is somewhat older, but it's still an enjoyable shopping experience.< /Review>

I like to give Costco 5 stars or even better than five stars except pharmacy over there.
Prescription is delayed than promised time without notification. Or some problems with prescription order take over the phone. He had hard time to locate all of my prescriptions.
I will change to other places than busy Costco Pharmacy<//review>

<review>The store itself is good, but the management needs to pay attention to the parking lot. The lot is small as it is, and it doesn’t help when most of spots are taken by shopping carts, and the workers who supposed to collect the carts are sitting under trees, chatting and smoking. I only blame the manager for not making the employees do their work.< /review>< userid>

Costco is one of my favorite places on earth. I don’t care for this location just because of where it is and it takes a long time to find parking. They need a 360 entrance and parking. Maybe even two entrances. The meat is great quality, and the prices are reasonable<//review>

<review>The most unfriendly Costco even been. The assistant was mean while my wife said forgot to take the ID (I have never been asked for ID before without purchasing alcohol). Costco is good, but we will never go to this store.<//review><gmap_id>0x809ac5c4f27885f5:0xbe295071682a2605< /gmap_id>< name>

This place is great! It has a wide selection going from food to furniture, it's perfect the only thing I don't like about it is that you need a membership to just get through the doors. Well you can go inside without a membership, but just to the food court.<//Review>

<Review>I gave it 2 stars because 1 the people here are so rude if it's a day they are handing out samples you will get ran over. No one says excuse me and hits into you like you are supposed to move. Don't be in a wheelchair it's worse a friend of mine got knocked out the way in her chair..... I would of gave it one but I have had some very nice workers help me even one who was on his way to his break stopped to help me........ Parking is the worse get there right at opening or before closing...< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809ac5c4f27885f5:0xbe295071682a2605</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Usual confusion and bumper cart activity from the clueless. Pay attention to your surroundings people. Employees were courteous and helpful as usual. I engage them all with a smile and a kind word and they respond in kind. Glad there is a new store opening soon in Elk Grove.< /Text>< rate>

Normally this Costco is great, but today I realized before exiting the store that I was charged twice for an item that I only got one of and it took over 15 minutes for someone to come to counter 51 to refund my money. I asked Customer Service 3 times to call someone, after waiting for the clerk at 5 minute intervals. It shouldn't have taken that long for a clerk to come do the refund,  especially since the store was not that busy.
On a positive note,  the young man who helped lift my heavy purchases into my car was very happy to do so, did so with a smile, and was very pleasant.< /review>

Went for black and yellow storage totes.  Couldn't find any.  Asked them to look them up  in the computer at the front.   The lady said they don't have any and when i asked about other stores near by she said the same.  None.  My husband was checking out and the checker went to find us the totes.  We bought 20.   Thank you David and Rich excellent customer service.  We spend thousands there.  Nice to be taken care of.</review>

Love that its bulk sales,  but dislike the pricing on some stuff lol
Diapers and diaper wipes are a great price tho!
Always walk in wanting one certain thing,  but walk out with a cart of nothing useful for over $100 😞😂< /Text>

Forgot to bring my Costco card so I went to stand in line at member services to get a temporary card. I recognize it was my own fault for not bringing my card, but in the time it took for them to help me, I could've driven home and back, at least twice, to get my card. It wasn't my most pleasant experience at a Costco. However, the staff are definitely friendly enough and trying their best. They either need more staff or a more efficient system for assisting members.

Other than that, this is a typical Costco and is set up exactly the same as most others. This one also carries the Costco craft beer selection that I haven't seen at some others. It doesn't carry Kirkland light.<//review>

Typical Costco - wide selection, change about every once in a while. Their return policy is great and their prices are good. Free food samples are pretty good too. Compared to other Costcos in the area, I like that this one has an indoor seating area, but it seems to get busier than the Arden location. Location is convenient right off the freeway.</text>

This store is a good store especially when you need a lot. The downfall is that it's always packed. I mean so packed it takes at least 5 minutes to get out of the store when you're done shopping. We desperately need the new store in Elk Grove.<//text>

My favorite store for high quality food. The  annuall membership is worth spending on the executive, because of the 2%  cash back every year.  I get about $90 back every year. The membership is $120/year</review>

Always spend too much. If you have the room to buy bulk amounts its cheaper in the long run. Good selection. Usually busy whenever I have gone , be prepared to stay a while.<//text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>(Sacramento Costco)  Why are your portable 2-way radios always blaring?  Why do your employees need to set its volume so loud that you can hear it even a mile away?  Are your employees deaf?  Do you want your customers to become deaf?  Or are you just tripping on the seeming "big shot" feeling that you need to show to the whole world that you are an employee of Costco.  My goodness sake!  Have some sense in your brains.  If you are not irritated by the loudness of your radios, just consider that some customers are.  One time I was in line for food and suddenly 2 radio blurted out in unison so loud that it hurt my ears.  There were 2 employees behind me with their radios.  I asked if they can turn in down and they just shrugged their shoulders.  WTF!<//Text></record>

A much better selection than the Costco by Cal Expo. Parking lot is huge and on most days it's pretty full. Their food court is inside and a bit small. The tire service centre is great.< /text>

Forgot to bring my Costco card so I went to stand in line at member services to get a temporary card. I recognize it was my own fault for not bringing my card, but in the time it took for them to help me, I could've driven home and back, at least twice, to get my card. It wasn't my most pleasant experience at a Costco. However, the staff are definitely friendly enough and trying their best. They either need more staff or a more efficient system for assisting members.

Other than that, this is a typical Costco and is set up exactly the same as most others. This one also carries the Costco craft beer selection that I haven't seen at some others. It doesn't carry Kirkland light.<//Review>

<Review>Good selection of goods.  Have monthly specials.  Will be crowded with long lines at check out depending on what time you show up.  Ditto with parking.  Tire counter was fast and friendly.  Your tires can be done within 1-2 hours.< /Review>< rate>

Being one of the most if not the most popular and busiest costco in the country, i feel that they do a fine job based on the amount of people that go through this store on a daily basis. I am very happy to conduct my business and purchases here as the employees are bombarded daily with overwhelming customer requests. Kudos! to the staff and company, keep up the good work!< /Review>

Love the new options and how if I come one week and the price of an item is ten bucks and I save the receipt, if I come back a week later and the same items price lowered as long as I have my receipt I could get refunded the difference ... long lines but quick service so it’s good< /Review>

I love Costco but this one is always over crowded and frequently out of things I'm looking for. Trying to get help from staff on the floor when looking for things is impossible. IF they ask if I found everything I needed at the register (which is maybe 1/6 of the time) the people that usually sit computer by the register who can check inventory for you are never there to help. They also need to keep more people at the food court line is never shorter than 10+ people even 30 minutes after opening.</Text>

This Costco is really small.  Not as big a selection as most other Costco stores.  Parking sucks, which is the same as every other location.  Bakery doesn't offer custom options for "custom" cakes.  I often find everything on my list, but always different brands and mostly not organic options.  Gluten free or vegan selections are dismal.  Sam's Club around the corner is more like the Costco stores I'm used to as far as selection, but I prefer to spend my money here instead of the Wal-Mart corporation.< /text>

I love Costco but this one is always over crowded and frequently out of things I'm looking for. Trying to get help from staff on the floor when looking for things is impossible. IF they ask if I found everything I needed at the register (which is maybe 1/6 of the time) the people that usually sit computer by the register who can check inventory for you are never there to help. They also need to keep more people at the food court line is never shorter than 10+ people even 30 minutes after opening.< /Text>

One thing that is the worst thing here is we can't get a data connection on our smart phone. Basically we are off the grid. We only go here if we have to. Can't wait for the new Costco to open in Elk Grove.

All in all its pretty much the same as other Costcos. Definitely nothing and I mean nothing out of the ordinary.

Oh and they have tired and gasoline at this location.< /review>

<text>We go to Costco for staples, like coffee, toilet paper & other paper products, bulk frozen chicken breasts & other meat, berries & other fruit, vitamins & other supplements, wines, & several other foods, clothing, books, appliances, flooring, upholstery & even travel services, new cars, etc. They have competitive prices on most things, but you will be buying in bulk, so be sure you can use the item before its expiration date!  The Kirkland brand is consistantly pretty high quality & can also you money. They don't carry everything we need & are not necessarily cheaper than all stores, but you can focus on the things in bulk that you need daily that can save you money in the long run. They also have internet & in-store coupons each month that help save money, & they carry unusual items you might not find elsewhere. We bought our last 2 TVs there & got a good price on both, & we have never had problems returning items.  On the downside, they tend to move things around or may stop carrying a product you have grown fond of, but they are always organized & the clerks friendly & helpful.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Today, when I was checking out, a cashier lost my membership card . And so I went to the member service place to replace  it, but the person that helped me kept saying in a demeaning tone that I can't replace my card since I already had a visa card, in the end she gave it to me sfter she seem frustrated with me asking for a replacement. That person didn't see to care and wasn't nice</Text>

The lines are almost always long and forget trying to get out in under an hour if you want more than one thing.  Even the checkers complain about mangers trying to cut costs/hours by not providing the checkers they need to keep lines short. Also never go to this Costco on a Holiday, I bet if a fire Marshal came in they would be over capacity. They need another Costco in Elk Grove to spread the customer load.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>We go to Costco for staples, like coffee, toilet paper & other paper products, bulk frozen chicken breasts & other meat, berries & other fruit, vitamins & other supplements, wines, & several other foods, clothing, books, appliances, flooring, upholstery & even travel services, new cars, etc. They have competitive prices on most things, but you will be buying in bulk, so be sure you can use the item before its expiration date!  The Kirkland brand is consistantly pretty high quality & can also you money. They don't carry everything we need & are not necessarily cheaper than all stores, but you can focus on the things in bulk that you need daily that can save you money in the long run. They also have internet & in-store coupons each month that help save money, & they carry unusual items you might not find elsewhere. We bought our last 2 TVs there & got a good price on both, & we have never had problems returning items.  On the downside, they tend to move things around or may stop carrying a product you have grown fond of, but they are always organized & the clerks friendly & helpful.< /Review><Response>None</Response>< user_id>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I'm only giving this Costco 5 stars because if someone of a influence reads this, please get a Costco built off I-5 and Cosumnes. While there are other Costco's in the city, the I-5 corridor doesn't have one until the city of Stockton. And north of Sacramento, not until the city of Woodland.

If I was honest, I'd want to give this Costco 3 stars due to the state it's in it's size and the selection of products and overall appearance. The staff are ok, usually somewhat helpful but can also have blinders. The quality of the products they have are what to be expected of Costco.
I prefer the size and selection of the Arden Costco and will try to find a reason to go to that location instead of my more local South Sacramento location.
The Citrus Heights Costco is PHENOMENAL. If you can find a reason to go there instead, DO IT. My wife and I have found ourselves there 3 times in the last few months.
While this Costco doesn't seem to be getting the corporate love that other locations in the city get, and while some of the staff could do better at their jobs, I'm also giving it 5 stars because it is truly my closest Costco so it's somewhat convient, but if if Sam's Club opened a store in South Sacramento off I-5, I'd probably never renew my Costco membership. Alternatively, if Costco opened something in South Sac off I-5, I'd cut Sam's out. I only have both because they're located together and both far from my house, so I visit both since it's a mission.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

One thing that is the worst thing here is we can't get a data connection on our smart phone. Basically we are off the grid. We only go here if we have to. Can't wait for the new Costco to open in Elk Grove.

All in all its pretty much the same as other Costcos. Definitely nothing and I mean nothing out of the ordinary.

Oh and they have tired and gasoline at this location.</review>

<rating>3< /rating><review>Costco itself is good like any other costco but I just hate this location.. it is hard to go back from there to Elk Grove because the streets are  not planned to make it easy.. my t mobile network is bad there.. the area looks annoying generally. I am waiting for their new Costco in Elk Grove.
Other than that there are items that I don’t find in this location, kinds of cheese and oil for example.
They have a gas station of 3 successive pumps that make lines move faster.
And yes of course the store is super busy.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

It's nice and has plenty of items but it's always so packed. The lines move slow the food takes really long and when you ask for help they seem to brush you off and get irritated.</Review>

Huge with lots of different things to buy. The only problem is that they introduce new items and then take them away.</Review>

My cashier was horrible!!!He had no manners and was so rude. Thinking he's above people he's an employee not the owner. He shouldn't belittle people. I will forever avoid that Costco!!!<//Review>

<review>Whenever I need something at Costco they always have it I can't believe there's a time that I've went and they were out of stock or the shelves were empty like Walmart LOL I like going to this Costco because it's closest one to me it's usually always packed though so that's a good thing that they are building another one off of Elk Grove Boulevard and Bruceville.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>I don't like how they took out the berry smoothie. It was my favorite drink of all time. I didn't know the last time i was going to have it was going to be the last time i would ever have it. Bring the berry smoothie back!< /Review>< username>

Great store. The only issue is parking, because you have to spend at least few minutes to find a parking spot.< /review>

This place sells a lot of stuff and we go here every once in a while, but the lines could get long and the customers in those long lines usually have a lot of stuff to buy and prices could get high. Also a good place to go if you need quick stuff if you are on California 99 north and you are exiting at Stockton Blvd.</review>

They saved our lives. Guys at tire center found a nail in our tire right before we drove 500 miles to LA. We didn't even know it was there. We just wanted to check the air before we started driving back home.
We could have had a blowout and crashed, but that's to them, we didn't.< /Text>

Costco is my second home. However, sometime I avoid going there, because every time I go there, I will spend at least $300, it is so addicting, always so much good stuff to buy.</Text>

You get good service here, but the product selection is quite small.<//Review>

This Costco location is jam packed busy almost all the time. It is a clean facility with good selection but the crowds lower my rating to 4 stars.</Review>

I've used food stamps and wasn't treated any differently from when I didn't use them. I'm very thankful that this location has gasoline because it is better priced; and I've had the best service with their tire center even after the completed sale.< /review>

Staff are pleasant for the most part.  But I get frustrated that it's overcrowded already and now they accept foodstamps.  That's not fair. IF people can afford to pay for a Costco membership, THEN WHY are they using our tax dollars to get foodstamps.  I HATE going to Walmart and other stores due to the OVERCROWDING, and we pay for our membership to get more frustrated!! Not right Costco!!!!< /text>

Well the line for gas and paying out is long mostly it depends what time of the day you are shopping and if you are planning to buy a pizza it will be a good idea to pre order over the phone one big mayor issue í have found is that if you have T-Mobil you have not service in this area about 1 mile radious so please call and complain to T-Mobil so this minor issue can get fix.</review>

Coming to your Costco is very chaos to try to come in there and get a parking spot. But I thank you for your nice service from your coworkers.<//text>

So many people come to  Costco, understaffed for sure. Lines are so long when it's prime time... You always know you are gonna spend 12 years in line when you go to Costco.</Text>

Tire center employees are rude and treat you like crap. I went to the  tire center to get a rotation on tires  that I  purchased at Costco. They took  more interest in  customers purchasing new tires over me. I guess  they  figured that  they  already  got  MY money and  they wanted someone else's over me.<//Text>

I love shopping at costco!!! I just dont like the parking. I am a disabled person and there are still not that many disable parking at all! Unless there are people who are NOT disable taking up the spots. (That is why I am giving only 4 stars)
Other than that, custumer service is very great/excellent! Their willing to help with most of everything (if you just ask) so far all the employees to me are very jolly and out going, also they try to help as much as they could. I just wish some customers had some respect and courtesy in the parking lots! I had my spot hijacked from me by a Hispanic woman! And thats not the first also she wasnt even disabled to even be parking in the spot!! Also I want to thank the person who was very kind enough to turn my phone and my membership card (if they read this) I accidentally left it some where near the photo center. I was excited to see how my pictures turned out. I'm very glad i have costco!!< /Text>

Is there someone that I can speak to about this experience?  As I dont believe that the response of ... "if it's too hot at this costco dont come back" is the message you want to send your customers..< /Text>< Pics>

Jamie in the food court was very rude tonight! I had pre ordered 2 pizza's when I entered Costco, did my shopping as I knew it was going to take at least 30 minutes for the pizzas to cook. I actually went and picked up my pizza's approximately 45 mins later. I went to the counter and Jamie didn't even acknowledge me standing there. He literally handed pizza's over my head to men customer's. After I tried getting anothee employees attention, Jamie asked me what I wanted. I gave him my receipt, he threw the pizza's on the counter and walked away. I tried to ask hom for plates and he acted like he didn't hear me. I am highly disappointed in the service I recieved and would not recommend anyone to pick up a pizza there.</review><UserId.>100395022171674354938<//UserId.>< user_name>

I love CostCo. Their Kirkland brand items are very very good and very cost effective. I save over $500.00 a year shopping with CostCo. I love their meats. I can buy 3-5 filet mignon for often less than 40.00! Their hamburger at 80% lean gets me for $18.95 just about 5 full pounds of tender non greasy hamburger meat. In paper goods: Kirkland bath tissue- 425 sheets per roll and $15.99 a case is a real savings bargain. Their paper towels rival household brand names in both durability and strength. I get 12 big rolls for $15.99. They last me 8 months. They have so many organic choices to choose from. All of them well priced. My favourite though is their spit roasted chicken. Seasoned perfectly and full of flavour. A 3+ pound chicken will cost you $4.99. CostCo can save you time and money if you know how to shop wisely. Give them a try. Grab some gas on your way out. Their gas prices are very good!</text>

CostCo is CostCo. The traffic in and out of the area surrounding this CostCo can be a little menacing at times due to high volume of members making there stops here in addition to local traffic. If you're patient and willing to stand the traffic leaving CostCo, then why not stop by and get what you need.
As of May 2017, their gas pumps were incresed from 12 to 18 and the station area was widened to improve vehicle entry and exit into the gas station. Well done!< /review>

< Review>
Worst Costco I have ever been to. While I was waiting to check out 2 african american associates complain about "the racist, rich white people who didn't care about them, that they were just servants". As far as I could see no one was acting that way, worst customer service i have ever had from anywhere. I would never stereotype them.< /Review>

CostCo is CostCo. The traffic in and out of the area surrounding this CostCo can be a little menacing at times due to high volume of members making there stops here in addition to local traffic. If you're patient and willing to stand the traffic leaving CostCo, then why not stop by and get what you need.
As of May 2017, their gas pumps were incresed from 12 to 18 and the station area was widened to improve vehicle entry and exit into the gas station. Well done!< /review>

I love CostCo. Their Kirkland brand items are very very good and very cost effective. I save over $500.00 a year shopping with CostCo. I love their meats. I can buy 3-5 filet mignon for often less than 40.00! Their hamburger at 80% lean gets me for $18.95 just about 5 full pounds of tender non greasy hamburger meat. In paper goods: Kirkland bath tissue- 425 sheets per roll and $15.99 a case is a real savings bargain. Their paper towels rival household brand names in both durability and strength. I get 12 big rolls for $15.99. They last me 8 months. They have so many organic choices to choose from. All of them well priced. My favourite though is their spit roasted chicken. Seasoned perfectly and full of flavour. A 3+ pound chicken will cost you $4.99. CostCo can save you time and money if you know how to shop wisely. Give them a try. Grab some gas on your way out. Their gas prices are very good!<//Review>

I spend $120 a year to be a member and I will be damned if I'm going to be treated rudely by any employee there. Jamie in the food court was very rude tonight! I had pre ordered 2 pizza's when I entered Costco, did my shopping as I knew it was going to take at least 30 minutes for the pizzas to cook. I actually went and picked up my pizza's approximately 45 mins later. I went to the counter and Jamie didn't even acknowledge me standing there. He literally handed pizza's over my head to men customer's. After I tried getting anothee employees attention, Jamie asked me what I wanted. I gave him my receipt, he threw the pizza's on the counter and walked away. I tried to ask hom for plates and he acted like he didn't hear me. I am highly disappointed in the service I recieved and would not recommend anyone to pick up a pizza there.<//Review>

<text>Only thing I wish they have is a 10 items cash register, for faster service, nowadays  people is not very considerate to let you go ahead them when you're waiting behind their fully load shopping cart with 2 items on hand 😔</text>< response>

Tire center employees are rude and treat you like crap. I went to the  tire center to get a rotation on tires  that I  purchased at Costco. They took  more interest in  customers purchasing new tires over me. I guess  they  figured that  they  already  got  MY money and  they wanted someone else's over me.</Text>

This store is racist.  I went to buy dog food for my new pup. My husband signed us up, but I didn't go in to get my card yet. I walked in the lady before me had no card present. When I walked up the woman stopped me and continuously asked for my card befor I could ask her where to take my picture. Then some other dude walked up asking me for my card. I was frustrated by then. Poor customer service. It's not like you can purchase anything without a card anyway.</Text>

Today I went over where the line sell icecream sundae something and then I stand there and wait for 10 but no one was over there and ask me for order or even tell me why they don’t sell icecream for me, they went over the other line and take order over many time and ignore me. I won’t go to that place with no respect with customer.< /Review>

<Text>Worst Costco I have ever been to. While I was waiting to check out 2 african american associates complain about "the racist, rich white people who didn't care about them, that they were just servants". As far as I could see no one was acting that way, worst customer service i have ever had from anywhere. I would never stereotype them.</Text>< pics>

This store is racist.  I went to buy dog food for my new pup. My husband signed us up, but I didn't go in to get my card yet. I walked in the lady before me had no card present. When I walked up the woman stopped me and continuously asked for my card befor I could ask her where to take my picture. Then some other dude walked up asking me for my card. I was frustrated by then. Poor customer service. It's not like you can purchase anything without a card anyway.<//review>

<Review>I find some of the things here are cheaper than Sam's Club.  However, there are some things cheaper at Sam's Club.   An example is Clorox was over $11 for 3 bottles @ Sam's however its 9.99 for 3 bottles same size @ Costco.  I bought a pair of Sketchers for $20 and the shoes @ Costco were $30.  There were more of a selection of shoes and clothes @ Costco vs. Sam's.  However,  I didnt like the way the shoes looked at Costco.</Review>< Rating>

The employees would not let me and my work crew have lunch inside. They said we had to have an escorts and they did not offer to escorts us. Why would I pay into a store membership if I can't see what is in the store? What's that all about?<//Review>

The employees would not let me and my work crew have lunch inside. They said we had to have an escorts and they did not offer to escorts us. Why would I pay into a store membership if I can't see what is in the store? What's that all about?< /text>

I can't stand the fact that they move their items around to make me wander around needlessly to find what I need.  I know you guys want me to be lost so that I would look at your other items, but I don't have time and can't ever find your employees to ask for help.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Very good place to save a few dollars on wholesale purchases. Part of my plan to save as much as possible in the year.

I recommend making a budget and comparing prices, in the end you save more doing this.
