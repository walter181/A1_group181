I came here for my 31st bday and had such a blast.  The door guys are really cool and easy going.  The bartenders are fun, efficient and quick.  The crowd was perfect. 20's-mid 30's well dressed crowd.  Everyone was there to have a good time and that was all.  The decor is really nice and cozy chic.  Out of place among the surrounding establishments, but no biggie at all.</review>

Great club! I had a private event at the club for a big birthday party and it was a great space! The room is beautiful, sound system is excellent. Perfect spot for those who want to dance and socialize. Payam and Sarah took care of every need and the staff was nice and made everyone feel welcome. I rate The EndUp highly.</Text>

<Text>Well, from what I recall, I had a blast.  Great music, strong drinks (be careful with these), lines were quick.  Totally worth the $15.  Everyone in there was having a ball.  I'll make it a point to stop here for another mash up night.  Dancing was the objective here so dress comfortable people.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Super fun place to go! Feels very underground and the place is full of hipsters and cool kids.  The music is amazing.  NOT top 40 but rather a mashup of house and hip hop alike.  The place was packed, everyone was shoulder to shoulder.  Do not go to this place if you want an ordinary club.  If you're looking for a music venue with loud music, intense crowd, and sweaty fun all over the place, then this is the place for you.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This club is not big, but pretty cool. I came here twice. One night the DJ was mixing amazing music and we had great fun. The other night music sucked, crowd was boring and it was a disappointment. I guess I need to go third time to make up my mind about this place.< /review>

Had a guest from NYC. Paid the cover for everyone at 1:59. They wouldn't serve drinks after 2, so we left immediately. Sober, we politely asked the manager to refund our cover, and they refused. Would have been great to at least had a warning at the door. $60 for 90 seconds. Absolutely, definitively, will not return, and will ensure anyone visiting will never end up at the EndUp.< /Review>

Awful. Bouncers create an artificial line so it looked full on a Friday night around 2am. Cover was hefty at $20. Music was poor on a non-event weekend. Not many people were at the venue and the ones who were there were smoking weed in the back. The dancefloor was pretty bare. The people at the entry also did not announce that alcohol was no longer server beyond 2am- something that non SF natives would never know! Anyway, never coming back.< /Text>

<Name>Carolina Ossa</Name><text>I’ve been a regular for a while...Went for a party that was advertised on facebook (twice) and eventbrite. Paid $30, and immediately upon entering it was something entirely different (different themed party, music genre, crowd, and artist). Immediately went to the cashier to ask what was happening, only to see that this is clearly not the first time this has unfortunately happened where she needs to side-step someone else's irresponsibility. She swept us aside and said to talk to the bartender’s, that’s where we’re likely to meet a manager. We speak to what we are told is a leader (shift lead/manager) and ask him what is happening. He tells us that the invite is incorrect, that we this is the party promoter and we have to talk to them and should try to get our money back.

After much asking everyone and getting nowhere, ask the bouncer if they know the party promoter, and was pointed to a man (Jeff, I believe?). long story short I ask him why the discrepancy between the event and the promotion and he gets incredibly defensive and rude. After trying to calmly talk to him he tells if we don’t stop asking questions and are not happy we’ll be kicked out. Upon realizing this we left. This was a very negative experience and I’probably won’t return.<//text>< time>

<user>105462781333223267580</user><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>I was so disappointed by how they treated us.

We went in after going almost every weekend, thinking it again was going to be reggaeton night based on their online advertising, on both their event page, Facebook and eventbrite. It wasnt, and when we realized (less than 5mins in) we asked for a refund. The cashier and promoted got very aggressive with us, until we felt uncomfortable and then when we complained they kicked out of the place.

Honestly, it's ok if the night didnt end up being what they planned, but I'm really not ok with how they responded. I will truly never go there again because they got so mad and aggressive with us and I dont think that's ok.<//text>< user_name>

I love the End Up at 2am, 4am, 6am and 2pm.  How can you beat a raised dance floor that other dancers will you help you up onto even when it's absolutely packed?  A fireplace on cold nights.  A waterfall on warm nights.  And one of the most dependable lineups in SF.

Thank you End Up for being a staple in the SF community.  I think my first visit was in '89.  I hope you'll still be here when I'm 89.</review>

A friend of mine was treated extremely rudely by a bouncer who clearly did not “approve”’ of her body type and an evening was ruined. This club seems to have earned all of its negative feedback. They don’t seem to cater to anyone that isn’t thin and white. Don’t give them your time or coins.<//Review>

I had fun for sure. Warning though it's too easy to stay here until 8am because free cover before midnight, alcohol and access to drugs suppliers. Though some nights there are no suppliers and just people asking you for things. I would go more if I didn't need sleep.<//Text>

This place is a total RIP OFF! stops serving alcohol at 2am but will still take your money and NOT let you know. I can not stress this enough, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Even if you do get here before 2am,  it stinks (like actually smells terrible) and the bartenders are SO RUDE.</Text>

<Time>1479271113867</Time><Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Went on a Saturday night, the cover was fairly cheap ($10). The dance floor was a little small. Drinks are reasonably priced, there is an outdoor smoking area, and while they didn't have a menu for typical bar food, they did have pizza available on site- $5 cash only. One downside was not being allowed to go out and come back in without paying cover again.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I remember the days of DJ Ruben Mancias and David Harness and Harry "Choo Choo" Romero. Just to name a few. The list goes on. That was 2000-2001 btw. Wonder if the music is the same< /text>

Contrary to some frightening reviews, the line was short and moved quickly (~10pm). The bouncers were professional and courteous. The drinks were strong and overall a good value. The bar lines were short and moved quickly. Overall, a very good experience.<//text>

<text>Oct 2014 - I went to The EndUp on my last night in SF. It was a good decision and I happily arrived back at my hotel at 5am. People are generally friendly here so if you are tired from the dancing, you can start a conversation with almost anyone. The rooms are quite peculiar so I'd say keep your minds open when you visit.</text></record>

We went to the end up for the evening of Sunday night, tea dancing. We were received as thugs by an aggressive bouncer who m pushed violently for no reason !!! I do not recommend this address. So we went to do the bars at the Beau and the BADLANDS where we had a great welcome!</Review>

<Review>We supposedly got on the "guest list" and were supposed to get in for free if we arrived before 3 or somthing like that. They charged our guy friends 70 and me and my girl 40. We were there on time!! we get inside and it wasn't even crackin. Made us wait in line for an hour but for what it was empty. If I could give it a 0 I would. DON'T COME HERE.

The Endup seems to discriminate against fat femmes. How can the cost of an event go from $0, to $20, and finally $50 in just minutes? Was it because of a patron’s body?

Venues in The Tenderloin used to be really cool and inclusive, I guess that’s a thing of the past.<//Text>

<Text>A really disappointing experience. The bouncers stopped the line at the African American group to let in over 25 Asian American individuals.  It is not about race but the bouncers didn't bother to listen to use and showed no respect to the people of color in our group.  One of or group members was not allowed in for calling out the hypocrisy and the rest of us just decided to follow suit.  From a person living in the Tenderloin this is really disheartening.  I thought a place like this would be all inclusive.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I’m not the only one lol. Do not go there. Over charges. Atmosphere not enjoyable. Also if you go you will be supporting a business that is clearly discriminatory in its practice. This is a public event. The club owner/manager and bouncers hand picks from various parts of the line based on how one looks. Bases entery price on looks. Not worth $20, $30, $50. They don’t honor the pre-tickets if you’re not female, and if you are, you have to have body or a cute face. And I haven’t seen too many females in my last few times attending. They also make it look like it’s packed by holding the line up. Don’t fall for it.<//Text><date>1528817474137< /date>< UserId.>

<review>Cover was $20, otherwise you’ll be waiting in an hour long line to get in free. Once inside the club is big and it doesn’t even fill up; maybe only 1/4, so I don’t understand the need for any type of line. They said a table is $300. I know this is SF, but so ridiculous. Not even worth it the “table” was wooden and literally only room for the bottle and your “table” doesn’t even have enough room to sit 5 people. Overall the club itself looks like any other cheap club in any other city, but because this is SF, somehow they get away with ridiculous cover. The music was alright, not worth it though. OH YEAH, they promoted the day party until 8pm, but closed by 7 and kicked everyone out.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

If you are a native San Franciscan, you have a love/hate relationship with this place. You have the mecca of great dance music, eccentric individuals, drunks and music lovers. I personally love the End Up, although the lines have been pretty ridiculous since it is the only after 2am spot where you can boogie if you aren't ready to go home. They have done extensive upgrades to their couches, back room area, patio area and upper small patio area. I have always enjoyed having a cocktail in their garden and just listen to great music. Their sound system is also perfect for the size of the venue and I have never danced harder at any other venue in the city. This place is made to sweat. They have also added bottle service to their venue if that is something you are looking for at the Endup, but honestly, it is not worth it at earlier times.< /text>

<text>This is a fun place to go for those who loved after hours dancing and getting wasted. I dont really find this place much of the fun because the music is just okay, the drinks r bad taste, and the area are always dirty and stink. The restroom is very dirty, and small. Women, get really annoying when they r trying to use the restrom because men can share women restroom too. Also, this place is really highly well-known for party animals. You know what I mean by that.

Hope this is helpful.<//text>< name>

If you really like to be abused, please do not miss this place!!! Just as an example my beer has been stolen in a matter of 5 seconds by a bar tender right in front of a friends eyes and they responded really violently when I claimed for muy beer. In terms of music, do not expect anything too sophisticated... Even if the place pretends to be shown as cool in the internet I heard there the worst latín rubish I was trying ti escape from. As said, if you really like yo be abused, do not miss It!!!<//Review>

Great House Music, great dj's, a definite San Francisco institution.  This is the type of place where you can meet a lawyer to your left and a homeless artist on your right.  Most of the people that go here are into music, House Music specifically as it's one of the BEST venues to hear the newest house music in the world.  There are some drugs (as much as other bars) and less than nice bouncers, the service isn't all that great although the drinks are STRONG, the music is the best and the people are interesting.  If you're a homophobe, older, not into crowds then someplace down the street is a better hang out for you...further down the street....down in the pennisula somewhere.< /review>

You have to be in the right state of mind for the end up...  They don't call it the end up for nothin!  If you are still awake at 4am and you aren't ready for the party to stop you just might "End Up" here.   Of course they is no liquor severed after 2am so if you don't wanna be sober I'm sure you could find other treats at this place as most sidewalk pharmacist end up here too.  I'm not sure what time the end up closes but its long after I'm passed out at home for sure.  Last time we ended up here we didn't leave until sometime after 7am.

They have an unexpected patio out back with plenty of seating I thought there was even someone selling hot dogs or something last time (but I may have just dreamed that lol)
There is also at least one pool table...  Its all a little hazy...

But if you are looking for the after party it is always at the end up.  So if you want to keep party rockin head to the End Up and pound Reb Bull all night.< /Review>

The place had a Facebook event for a dance party from 6am-10am but when I showed up at 7am all the doors were locked and when I asked a bouncer, I was told they weren’t letting anyone in. A little disappointing.<//review>

I had a pretty poor-experience the other night by this franchise's location's staff.  I took my girlfriend with me to go 'attempt' to get some ice cream the other night, and ultimately ended up waiting for over 20 minutes in the line outside.  I understand that with the recent restrictions, that it is necessary for it to be this way - however, given that there's only 4 individual-groups allowed within the store at one time, it should have taken much less time than it did.  This was compounded by the fact that everyone (along with us, who were outside) noticed that the employees were simply talking amongst each other, and not really attempting to speed the wait along.
Sadly, the worst part was that the hours stated that they were open on here until 23:00 (11pm), but we were told that the "last customers" were being served; being the people right in-front of us in line, and so we were told to leave.  Seemed like management could use re-training, or at the least - remedial communication training, considering they couldn't even be bothered to come outside and let us all know that they were closing shortly; instead, we ended up having to be the ones to let everyone else know that service would be discontinued.
Overall, this certainly left a lasting-impression of this store's location, and we will likely pursue alternatives; rather than return to this store.  It really is too bad, as they certainly left a lot of people upset over that, and i'm sure we aren't the only ones who feel the same way.  Wish I could give it 0/5 stars, as ice cream was not even attainable, but suffice it to say, there's a dire need for reorganization from their leadership.  I hope this was useful, and assisting, to anyone who is considering going there - particularly if you're on a time-crunch of some sort.</review>

To me the ice cream was a little to soft I'm not sure if it's always like that or if it was because it was just a hot day. The staff are friendly, and the store is neat. They have a lot to offer more than others that I've seen. They have Carmel apples, chocolates, and ice cream cakes.</text>

I came here at 9:30 PM and their doors are locked. I knocked on the door and there are people in there but they are not responding to me. The door hours say they close at 10 PM and online it says the same thing but they are obviously not open for business as advertised. Huge disappointment<//Review>

I was waiting to get served for my online order- whereas they noticed me, but didn’t come to ask me the simple question of “How can I help you?” Or even say “We’ll be with you in just a moment.” They ignored me at the counter, and when one of the workers came to “help” me, he looked at me, I told him I was picking up for an online order, and he aggressively sighed and looked away to check. He didn’t even update me on the status of the order. I feel like a Karen, but I’ve worked in customer service for a little bit, and this kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable under ANY establishment.<//Review>< Time>

A great place to go for a sweet treat and to get out of this heat.  I can't remember the first store we went to but when we did, that was all it took for us to make it one of our favorite places for ice cream.

I always have them make me the "Rocky Road" with extra  almonds.. Everyone else picks something different most of the time but it doesn't matter whatever the flavor, its good.<//review>

the first time we went there the Mr. Aldo provided us with so much info about his products that her served and what his best suggestions reviewed by other costumers of his as this was my first time there. Every thing looked so delicious and so fresh and creamy. 😋 So I wwnt with his coffee ice cream bc I love coffee and it didn't disappoint at all. not that I expected it too BUT Aldo's is the real deal ITALIAN ICE CREAM AND GELATO shop around town. My husband got the fruit gelato and my son got the peanut butter ice cream in which they both truly enjoyed. I highly suggest to give them a try if you haven't given them a shot yet.  Thank u Mr. Aldo and his friendly crew 👌💯</Text>

Absolutely one of the BEST Cold Stone's in the Valley.  I have tried Pleasanton, Livermore, Dublin, etc. The ice cream never taste as good as the one in Tracy.  The Ladies: (Leticia, Katelyn and Emily) ROCK the Customer Service Repor.  They go through PAIN STAKING efforts to fill your orders to PERFECTION.  They are kind, patience, knowledgeable and full of smiles.  They make a 'Watermelon Sorbet' that will send you to the moon.  The store is clean and very inviting.  KUDOs Ladies!!!  You make running an ice cream parlor look magical!!!!</Text>

<review>David’s customer service is superior! He exceeded my expectations, serviced each of my request, and proactively worked with me to resolve issues. I arrived on a Saturday AM shortly after the store opened. Unfortunately he was the only one working. Behind me came a few more customers. I bring nearly 20 years of customer service experience so I know what to look for. David responded so very well to the pressure and is an asset to AT&T!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Joseph and David Nava have a way of convincing people to buy phones. Watch out for  them, great guys and great customer service. They have fixed most of my bill issues or directed me to someone that will. Will go back when I need a new phone. Thanks Guys keep it up.<//Review>

We came in to upgrade my husband's phone on Saturday.   There were issues with att on our account with some combined billing BS that gave us some problems with our upgrade  Rafael the manager was great. He was so patient and even as busy as the store got he still continued to work with us to fix the issue without leaving us alone.  Three people on the three different phones with customer service, Rafael finally reached someone that could help.  2+ hours later we were upgraded. It was some system issue on the customer service side but the store and Rafael were amazing.   While our stent in the store we could tell you the service they provided to each customer that came in was fantastic as well. They were all courteous and looked to be  very genuine in all there interactions.  Att customer service on the phone leaves a lot to be desired and I'll be escalating up the ladder for that but if you need a phone... do not hesitate the team in Hollister!<//review>

ATT could give me their services for free and I wouldn't take it. I forgot all the problems that led to the decision to switch to another cable provider, but I do remember they made it hell to finally do it. I remember they avoided, on several different incidents, resolving problems with our internet connection and equipment, and were threatening to charge me for a house call. When I was finally fed up, and called to have them disconnect my services, they sent me 20mi away to a cellular store to take the equipment back. The store refused to accept it. They finally asked me to return it to a UPS store right by my house, but a few months later, they claimed I never returned it, and tried to charge me $600 for what amounted to a ten year old router. When they sent me to collections, I had luckily found the receipt and managed to clear my good name. It's been ten years since, but I will never use ATT again for ANYTHING!<//Review>

I got my replacement phone and tried to swap the screen protection sheet. ATT business help center suggested me to go to a local ATT store to get assistance. I went to ATT Hollister last weekend and got great help from Antonio.
He helped me to swap the screen protection sheet beautifully and even swapped the case for me.  Great service! Thank you ATT and Antonio!<//review>

I give this location zero stars.  It would not let me post with zero stars. Worst experience , retailers who don't know anything about the product. They have attitude when they talk to you . Make it feel like they don't want the business or sale .  They try to double the sale when you only ask for one .<//review>

I was only unhappy the last time I was there.  My phone got sick and it was time to replace with a newer Samsung Galaxy.  I was sold their Galaxy 7.  If they had
Mentioned that the Samsung 8
Would be coming out the NEXT WEEK, I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE.  INSTEAD SHE SOLD ME AN S7.   But buyer beware next time....expensive phone, but I thrive on the tech stuff so I'm paying a little more but my phone..., ALWAYS works .....< /Text>

The customer service here leaves something to be desired. I left several voicemails without so much as a call back and am already regretting going through the process of switching from Verizon.< /review>

When your furry child of over 11 years falls ill & has never before, you *need* TLC, ownership (being treated as you’d if the pet were yours) & with the skill, experience, compassion & empathy warranted in such cases. Drs Bolich & Chatcuff, all the nurses & vet techs, frontline team Melissa & Abby, are truly exceptional human beings & professionals.
This was so very scary for us & at a rather tender time in life, even more so. Thank you, Team VCA Bayside & San Carlos — you rock!!❤️🙏🌟</Text>

We have been taking all four of our animals to Dr. Bolich for many years.  She has been very thorough and detailed in explaining the treatments and procedures.  Her follow up after a visit are always appreciated.  The staff have always been kind to us and our animals.  We always refer friends to VCA Bayshore who are looking for a vet.

< review>
They took my cat in to the ER and charged up 6k without diagnostic and it overall felt like they were trying to take our money and not actually figure things out. We also went here to pick up our cat when they called us to and they were not ready and had to come back 3h later. Really bad customer service at the front door, Wouldn’t be coming here again.</review>

Each time I need to order flea medications they insist that I have to bring my healthy cat in for an exam.  They told me the next available appt is in 3 weeks.  I agreed to make an appointment but they refuse to sell me flea meds until then.  I will be choosing a new vet.  Very disappointed in their service.</Text>

I have a careclub membership of this hospital but I never get a good service from them. I want to schedule an neuter surgery from march this year, then I got pushed to Oct because of the COVID things. i understand that but then, they said my cat is sick they can't do the surgery that day. No one told me that before when i did the blood test.
Then they told me the next avail date is next March which is totally unacceptable to me. Because I am a club member, the surgery fee is covered. But it will expired next year March. That means I not only need to wait but also have to pay for it myself for that surgery. I think they are trying to get more money as they can from you. They don't care about your pet at all. My cat is suffering because of his rut, but they don't care, they just told me to wait and wait until my careclub membership expired.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Thank you everyone at the VCA Bayshore location 🌸 It was our first time boarding Max and he looks like he had an enjoyable experience too! Since the day I called staff has been extremely professional and welcoming.

Very clean facility, Max will definitely be back anytime I travel for business. We give it two paws up! 🐶<//text>

I ended up leaving with nothing but I still had to pay $80 for the "checkup."

I went to a different vet and everything was way cheaper, and the heartworm test was only $68 and it was not required to get the Next Guard prescription.

VCA was great. Dava, Dr.Iva and the whole staff took great care of my cat Bob with a injured front paw. They were professional and very gentle with Bob. My cat is comfortably recovering now. Bob says " thank you VCA,🦁👍".
They were open Sunday too which saved us. I highly recommend VCA pet hospital. Thank you VCA from the Bacon family.<//Review>

We’ve had several vets throughout the Bay Area for both basic and specialty dog care. This particular group is just awful. Their individual doctors range in abilities, but our most recent seemed incompetent, trying to prescribe us medicine that would have harmed him due to prior (known to her) conditions. We had to intervene to course correct.

Nothing has been easy here. Expect to have to call several times to get a prescription filled, and expect to be told frequently that you can’t be helped for 24-48 hours (they are often not staffed by docs over weekends, making their emergency care claims invalid).

The front desk staff is amazingly unhelpful, the care is dangerous and the prices are equally as high as better care centers. Save yourself the time and aggravation and go literally anywhere else.< /text>

< Review>
I have been going to VCA Bayshore for almost 10 years! They have been fantastic for all of my pets needs. Whether it's a check up or my dog or cat is sick they always take such good care of us.
I get updates from the doctors to let me know about my pets test results or just to check how they're doing.
I was really impressed how above and beyond VCA Bayshore goes for their clients - After we put our 20+ year old cat down the doctors sent us a card, which I thought was so thoughtful.< /Review>

They  charge me for an general exam I didn't ask. I just want the vaccines but they did another thing without asking. I felt like they are interested just in the money and not in the animals.
Update 9-23-18 I came again because my cat has an injury infected. They were totally not care about my cat, they gave me an appointment to 10 days later and told me I can go to the emergency that is next their local. On that emergency they didn't want to attend my cat because he seems not I'm danger, they told me if he gets worse bring him again.
I was sure his injury does not look good so I went to another place (SAGE, and I totally recommend this place!). My cat was with a really bad infected injury and needs antibiotics immediately.
Really upset about the quality professional of VCA!</Review>

<text>I have been going to VCA for about a year.
Dr. Anna Jones was my vet, and she was a gem.
She left.
I never really had any issues with this VCR.
I not only had had few checkups there with Fluffy, but got my flea pills from them.
Last week I called them and wanted to ask a medical question, did not even get a chance to ask, and this very rude woman Shareen cut me off for I don't no what reason.
She is nasty.  She might be being rude to other people.  Who knows.
If she does not like her job, she should get out.
I was shocked by this and I will never go back.
I asked this unpleasant woman to ask the manager Charlotte to call me, she never did.
I deserve an explanation, that is fair
You do not ignore people.
There are 2 sides to a story, but it does not always work out like this for anyone.
Obviously, this place in not running right, especially since Dr Jones left.
Don't go there.
Move on to another vet.
There are plenty of pleasant ones out there.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1484082566917, 'text': "Adrienne, we're disheartened to read the experience you describe as it does not align with out team's unwavering commitment to compassionate and professional care.

Phenomenal car service and repair. Johnny and Devon have a great team. They are always straightforward on what my car needs and why. They get the work done quickly and right, and will go the extra mile to make sure I have a great experience. Best auto repair in LA, hands down.< /Text>

<Review>My 2020 Mini cooper got rodent damage last week and I was looking for a reliable repairing store to fix this. Since I don't really understand cars and I always find the guys in repairing stores are scary, I feel super lucky that I found these friendly and professional guys to fix the car.

Originally the official dealer asked me 19k to fix/replace the damaged wires, but Superformance only need 950 to fix the wires without replacing entire wire which is nice.

Will always send the car for them in the future (yay!)</Review>< rating>

I've gotten my car serviced by the team at Quick Stop several times already since I live nearby. Ronnie and Tommy are pretty knowledgeable and good at explaining why you need something done with your car. Beyond that, they are reasonable with prices and honest.< /Text>

Not much I can say about this place other than the service was 4 star.  I usually have a reliable mechanic that I can go to when ever I am having car issues but he was away.  So I decided to ask Yelp for help.  Out of all the responses I got, Superformance Foreign Auto Repair auto service stood out as the next best mechanic I can go to.<//text>

Cars are not my thing.  I like looking at them, admiring them, and most of all driving them.  Simply put, my extent of knowledge on this subject ends there.  I have a feeling the majority of the public fits this similar profile.<//Text>

My engine oil leaked on my Mazda, and they were able to locate the specific part causing the problem and fixed it right away.  Was expecting hundreds of dollars but they only fixed the specific part that broke and was able to get it fixed for a very reasonable price under $100.  The people there were really friendly too!< /Review>

In short, they did not deliver the service they promised. After a week I sent my car there, a different technician told me they could not fix and they never promised before. I sent my car a week before but the issue on dashboard remained so I contacted them and they would like to look into that again to fix it. There are two points I felt being tricked and furious: When another technician who said he was charged at fixing my issue called me, his attitude was irritating and arrogant just like I did something wrong first. Also, their inconsistent information made me wonder if they had a fight in the shop which resulted in different replies to the same customer and issue.< /review>

It took me over a decade to find an honest mechanic.  Jim has earned my business because every time I take it there, he does the job right, diagnoses well, fairly priced, and if they make a mistake (they did, albeit a minor mistake) they fixed it right away at no extra charge for the upgraded parts.</Text>

The Best Automotive Repair in California! The money I've saved over the years has been incredible. They are the best with customer service and work very efficiently.

Simply the best. The alternator died on my 1982 Mercedes 380 SL at 2pm last Friday. I needed my car back for the weekend so called Superformance immediately. While I had my car towed there they had the replacement part delivered. I was up, running and out the door with a new alternator and an oil change by 5pm.< /Review>

Johnny and his team have been great for me over the past couple of years.  On my first visit I had a rather pricey hydraulic pump issue on my car and was reluctant to deal with my warranty company.  Johnny and Tom dealt with it and my car was fixed and paid for in a very timely fashion. Throughout this experience Johnny and his staff were professional and above all communicative, keeping me updated so I knew how long it would be.<//Review>

I have been driving European cars for the past 30 years mostly Mercedes and Jaguars and I know a top end mechanic when I see one , Superformance came highly recommended by car buff friend of mine ,  it's definitely one of the best Auto repair shops in California , so if you're looking for a skilled thorough and honest mechanic you're in luck this is the place .<//text>

Great Service,  Woke up to my CLS63 AMG with a rough idle and check engine light on.   Called Johnny and dropped off my car at noon.  He called me to tell me I had a misfire on Cylinder #4 and needed a new coil.  He had my car back the same day by 4:00pm!!  Definitely recommend!< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I'd like to start by expressing my appreciation in making a stressful situation far less stressful!  My 2004 Mercedes C class decided stalling on the 405N was a good idea, I'm just so thankful my smartphone was smart enough to suggest Superformance as they were less than a mile from my car.  With a simple phone call Johnny walked me through getting a tow truck and even stayed on the phone with my girlfriend until the tow was confirmed.  Upon my arrival, Johnny and his business partner Tom calmed my nerves, assured me they would sort my car out ASAP, and promised to keep the price fair.  2 days later my car was feeling better than it had in years and even came back washed!  They are my new shop, I will gladly make the 9 mile drive to receive the sort of automotive and customer service I thought had gone out of fashion in the auto repair industry.

Thanks Again,
Brian<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1366323340371, 'text': "You're very welcome! Thank YOU for taking the time to leave a review.

<rating>5<//rating><review>On my visit last week on I-5 in Lodi, I stopped in Sinclair after I was refused to use the bathroom in the neighboring Shell station after I filled up my tank.
Their bathrooms were closed to the public period.  I really had to go, so I went to  Sinclair to use their restrooms and purchased drinks and a auto brush.
If I would have known that, I would have gone to Sinclair first, I will from now on.  The gas prices were good and the workers were very polite.  Sinclair you get my 5 stars!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Beware of this place, i was driving around on 02/16/2021 shopping for quote for a front end wheel alignment only. I knew that my truck needed the Toe adjusted because i was hit by a drunk driver and it messed the alignment up, so me needing an alignment was a fact.

I pulled up to shop and didn't know where to park so i asked a employee "alignment" ? The guys directs me on where to park and he calls another guy over. I asked the other guy "how much for a alignment?" he doesn't answer my question and he asked for my key which i found strange but i said ok.

The Guy drives my truck of the lot and comes back without saying a word and pulls my truck into the shop, he then comes back out two minutes later asking for the trucks information. I give the guy the information and i follow him inside because at this point im not sure whats going on or what hes doing to my truck.

To my surprise my truck is already on the alignment rack in the air with the alignment sensors on each wheel, which i found strange because i had not approved any work and i wasn't even given a price. The guy calls me over to show me how much my alignment was off by and i agreed, Remember i already knew for a fact that i needed a alignment. The guy states that he could ONLY ADJUST THE TOE and not the Camber or the Caster, i asked him "so whats the cost" he them replies "$75" and gives me a little story on why its more expensive to align a truck compared to a bmw or a honda. So i told him that i would replace the work tie rod ends to ensure i get a good alignment and i would come back. The guy then hits me with "ok but thats a 25$ inspection fee" and this point im confused because i never signed a paper or even agreed to a inspection knowing my truck NEEDED a alignment.

I ladies and gents call this EXTORTION i was forced to give them my money no matter on what route i chose to go, i never asked for a alignment or an inspection i only asked for a price. I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission to notify them of these terrible business practices. No customer deserves to get charged for something they did not approve of.

A little back story on my Automotive Knowledge
I helped Manage Lobo Tech Auto on 4275 S Avalon here in LA for a while and i was the master mechanic at American Tire Depot in Santa Monica so i know what a alignment consists of and how long it should take. The guy that ATTEMPTED to align my truck took 20 minutes MAX fixing the toe and it still came out terrible.

I love supporting small businesses thats why i was shopping around in the neighborhood but i would just recommend going to a reputable business like PepBoys or American Tire Depot for a alignment, yes they might be more pricey but its worth it and they offer warranty Castellons Tires does not well thats what they Guy that assisted me said .< /text>

Super nice. Patched two tires when the Mercedes dealer said they don't fix run flats and wanted to charge me $450 per tire. Instead it was $10 to fix each tire.   Hopefully they stick.< /Text>

<text>There was innocent miscommunication, and I didn't follow through until I realized the wrong tires were put on.  I accept responsibility, and they went out of their way to make sure I could find the right tires, drove to pick them up and had it done fast with the installation.  Maybe this is a family business, and it is nice to support something like this.  Thanks to Castellon's Tires for making it happen before a drive up into the snowy conditions!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Friendly workers. Went in for an alignment but wished I would have known beforehand that it was only a front wheel alligment. I also didn't receive a before and after print out like other places do.<//review>

I called and spoke with Jose who said he would charge me $10 to do it which was a bargain. Had my car towed there and he took care of it on the spot and the kicker was he said to only give him $5. Paid the $10, but had to post a review about my experience. 5 star service with 5 star people. Gracias Jose!!< /Review></record>

This place is such a find for inexpensive tires - new or old.  About 2/3 the price of Pep Boys, etc., and the guys are experienced and have good new discount tires.   All my needs go here if possible, and I have a new Leaf and a Highlander that they have put tires on and aligned. Love them.</Text>

Fun little spot.
Seems like an older spot.

It's got a little bowl that's not bad. Maybe 4 feet deep on one side, slopes slightly downhill, then it's maybe 6 feet deep with another foot extension. Metal coping.

It also has a little "bird bath" bowl. Maybe a foot and a half deep? Maybe 6 feet by 8 feet? Good for little tiny kids...

The rest is step cement quarter pipes, more quarter pipes with no coping...

Fun Spot. Kinda just ok.

Street Parking.

There were bathrooms there, but they were locked...</Text>

Concrete Heaven, excellent novice to expert pieces. Beginner mini pool as well. Enjoy and bring self defense items. Even though it's across the street from Westminster P.D.  Some humans get rowdy enough for the City to use CCTV. Bathrooms are open as of now.</review>

Stayed here to clean my car for about 2hrs... very relaxing and friendly park. Safe cause there's a cop station at the main light which is like a couple hundred feet away. So no dead beets stay here lol.. recommend coming with family or to just clean car!<//review>

Update 2: the skate park got cleaned up but is still a little dusty and slippery making it hard to skate.

Please note: This skate park is currently filled with Dirt/sand to keep skaters from skating due to the pandemic!

This skate park has a pretty good sized bowl and a smaller one too, also has somewhat of a vert ramp with rails you can do other cool tricks on.. really nice skate park 100% recommended going!<//review>

Good size park, the playground equipment is getting worn down though. The base of the playground is sand, which is a cheaper than a rubber base obviously, but incentivizes immature kids to throw it on the slides. They mix it with water so your toddlers can't enjoy the slides, which is just annoying. Need some better parenting there. Other than that it's decent enough.</text>

The skatepark is lackluster. It has a bowl maybe 20 feet by 15 feet,decent coping and about 5 feet deep. The rest of the skatepark has about 5 quarter pipes with no coping,one rail that's 10 feet long and 1-1/2 foot tall and a 7 stair. Not much of a skatepark but still good for a warmup.
Now,if you're looking to host an event,barbecue or family gathering, this place is actually kind of nice. There are several picnic tables under canopies for shade and a big field for soccer or other activities. There's also a basketball court.  An average park,I'd say.</Review>

I cannot say enough good things about Don Wright! My husband and I were at our wits end and our home had sat on the market for 40days. I out of desperation called and left a voice-mail for an agent to call me back. We lucked out and Don called us back. Within a few days Don not only was able to re-market our home, but he called us with the amazing news that we had 2 offers above asking price! First time ever I literally cried tears of joy. Don is professional, prompt and 100% all about his clients! Do not hesitate to reach out! I did and I could not be happier! Thank you Don, you have been beyond wonderful and so professional!< /Review>

Daniel was incredibly helpful with the sale of our home, going above and beyond what most brokers do. He was able to secure us an extra $50,000 in the sale price based on his renovation recommendations. He did a tremendous job with the photography and video footage of the house, and we received multiple offers the first day it was on the market. Daniel is extremely easy to work with, he listens to your concerns, and appropriately addresses them finding solutions to any problems that you may have. Overall, the experience was seamless and easy and we received more in the sale price than we ever imagined.  I strongly urge you do you utilize his talents and skills as both a realtor and as a family man as he truly understands the sentimental value that a home can have with you. If you are looking for good communication, the ease and stress-free process of buying or selling, and someone who truly cares about you in this process, then Daniel and his group are the brokers for you!<//text>

Daniel and the Del Real Group helped us purchase our dream home. This was a sticky purchase as there were 2 existing offers on the home and we really wanted it. Daniel and his team were experienced and professional and never flinched and did everything he could to get us the home. And.. we were able to get it.
That was 5 years ago. In that time, we have had questions and have reached out and not once were we disappointed. Each time they took the time to find an answer or give an educated opinion on our need.
Now as our needs have changed and family has grown and we are looking again to purchase, with no hesitation will we go with the Del Real Group as they have earned our trust and business again. We like that they also continue to honor and connect with previous clients with communication as well as big family oriented events such as renting out a movie hall and doing themed events. Just a fantastic business and we appreciate them.< /Review>

<Review>Daniel was a great realtor to work with. Dealt with us sending him random listing we found, and took us to them, even though he knew they probably weren't the one. In the end he found us the perfect house. He was professional and I would 100% recommend. If we ever purchase another home, we won't hesitate to call. He personally came by around Christmastime to give us an ornament the first year, he sends us a Christmas card every year. Great personal customer service.< /Review>< Rate>

My Husband and I worked with our agents Amanda and Carlos, along with Fernando for marketing our home. Fernando did such a wonderful job on the video, pictures and drone coverage of our property. Our house looked beautiful! We were short on time to show the house due to work schedules but Amanda and Carlos worked with us. We were able to do majority of our showings in one day, which was so much easier for us. Since this was our first time selling, they explained the process every step of the way! It has been a pleasure working with Carlos and Amanda and the whole Del Rio Group!!<//text>

Andy Del Real is hands down the best agent I've ever worked with. He facilitated the best house purchase I've ever made. He went above and beyond what any real estate agent is even capable of. He turned a dubious prospect into a reality by negotiating directly with the bank. Throughout the process, Andy was polite, courteous and respectful. I have recommended him to others without reservation. I would highly recommend him to anyone interested in purchasing a property.<//Review>

My brothers and I purchased a new home for my parents.  Daniel went above and beyond to find the right listings that met all the requirements they were looking for in a home.  When we found the right home Daniel's negotiating skills were superb.  I've done numerous real estate transactions from personal, to investing, to development and I've never experienced the level of personal care and skill I did with Daniel and his team.  You can tell they absolutely love and believe in what they do by the care they take throughout the process.  This is anything but just another transaction for them, they made us feel like we were their only client and the attention to detail is unmatched.

We were able to tell my dad, on his 80th birthday, along with my mother that Daniel was able to negotiate for us to get the house and they accepted our offer over another very strong offer that was even higher than ours.  I cannot recommend the Del Real Group strongly enough!<//review>< pictures>

I've been doing business with the Del Real Group for over a decade now for all our Real Estate investment needs. The Del Real Team prides themselves on honesty, integrity, transparency and excellent customer service. They have excellent marketing, networking, business development and ethical skills that has enabled them to find repeat customers and referrals. I always pride myself in providing referrals for the Del Real group to all my friends, families, coworkers and other acquaintances knowing that they will always exceed expectations. Their team also consists of very knowledgeable, qualified, courteous, respectful and professional staff who deliver excellent customer service and are also very prompt in assisting with all our Real Estate needs. Both Andy and Daniel are my "Go To" people for seeking advice/guidance/referrals and recommendations ranging from tenant application screening, contracts, notices, background search and other financing/contractor needs. They also have State of the Art marketing, technology, photography and electronic web information that makes them a leader in this industry. I recently referred a Physician recruiter from Texas to the Del Real Team as he wanted tour the Central Valley so he could find housing for a new Physician who was planning to move to Modesto. Andy/Daniel personally took the initiative to pick up the individual from the hotel and provide a tour of Modesto. In addition, they provided some excellent brochures and a link to the website where he was able to learn so much about the valley. This is just one example of the many great things the Del Real Team has done for us and I certainly wish them all the success in the future.</Text>

The Deal Real group respond to your every need or want quickly, efficiently and effectively. They are masterful with their pictures and presentations. They are great negotiators. They are wonderful closers. They leave no stone unturned. Buying or selling a house is stressful when you’re the homeowner. The Deal Real Group take that headache away so you can spend your time on any other pressing personal needs during the sales process. Simply the best.< /Review>

< Review>
We used Daniel Del Real to sell our home in Salida, CA recently and he was outstanding.

Before choosing a real estate agent, I conducted a lot of research to see who would be the best choice based on the investment they make into selling the property (time and effort, not necessarily financially) and how they promote their listings. The Del Real Group stood out as the best Modesto has to offer: their organic rankings are excellent (meaning people find listings on his site easily), their social media presence was strong, and I could tell they put a lot of work into their listings.

We spoke with Daniel and then met with him at our home. He spent hours answering our questions, providing objective data regarding how many homes they sell, how long their listings typically stay on the market, and providing tons of info on comps in the area. We were concerned that our house, which was located pretty far from downtown and in a neighborhood with hundreds of similar homes would be tough to sell. Daniel made the process incredibly easy and took extra steps many other Realtors don't (but should), like having professional photographs taken, video and drone footage of our home and a lot more.

When we saw our listing we were blown away. His hard work and knowledge of what it takes to sell a home really paid off - our listing looked amazing and knocked out the competition.

Our house went under contract 6 days after we put it on the market. We accepted and Daniel walked us through every step of the closing process. It couldn't have been a more pleasant experience.

I've recommended the Del Real Group to everyone I know. He's a true professional and a genuinely nice guy. I realize it won't always be this easy to sell your home, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better Realtor.< /Review>

One thing he has said to us the first time we have ever used him was “I work on your pace, you tell me how fast or slow you want me to go.” He’s amazing and very helpful with knowledge of areas and asking the right questions to owners and pushing things for you if you want it.

In 2018 we were looking to purchase our first home in Modesto, CA.  We searched for the best real estate agent in the Central Valley and found Daniel and the Del Real Group.  Although we thought we knew exactly what we wanted and where we wanted to live, Daniel patiently helped open our eyes to other possibilities.  Ultimately, we found our dream home in an area we initially turned down.  That was just the start though. The purchase process turned out to be significantly more complex than expected.  Despite being experienced buyers, having purchased a half dozen homes prior, the sellers wanted to change terms and cancel the contract.  We thought we would lose our dream home. That is when Daniel and the Del Real Group really shined above the rest.  Daniel had everything prepared to ensure our highest chance of success.  In the end we secured the home and lived happily ever after.  This would not have been possible without Daniel and the Del Real Group, in my opinion, one of the top residential real estate agents and agencies in the nation.<//Text>

I have had the absolute best experience on my home buying adventure with one of their amazing realtors. Jared Howell from the moment I got into contact with him has helped me and my family in our still ongoing effort of finding our home. Today's market isn't easy to navigate but Jared has made himself available quite literally 24/7. We've been doing old tricks and finding new ones to help not only our family but others. I have never felt so much like family as Jared has made us feel. He has a drive to help and has the heart not many have anymore. He really does work for you. Him and his team really do work for you with you to make dreams come true. I can't wait till we get our forever dream home and be able to celebrate with the whole team. He is also someone I will be suggesting to anyone that's had a rough experience in the past and just needs the extra touch of care! We've been trying for years and we are going with a VA loan. If you have any doubts at all or any hardship I would reach out to the great team of the Del Real Group 100 percent.</Review>

We loved working with Andy, he is very professional and was very attentive to our needs when looking for our house and most importantly he had a lot of patience and always had the answer to our concerns, he always went further to help us have all the documents we needed. He helped us sell our house and buy another house and that the transition from one house to the other was coordinated and appropriate. Carlos and I are very satisfied with the support we received from Andy, he did an excellent job</Text>

<Text>Daniel Del Real is one of the hardest working agents in CA Real Estate and I say this being a Real Estate professional in CA myself.
Daniel manages deals for his own clients and manages his whole De Real Group Real Estate Team.
There are many people that work in real estate but Daniel has set himself a part as one of the best, most reliable, and most efficient real estate professionals in California.
He managed the sale of my personal residence, during a difficult divorce I was going through, in a professional and efficient manner while getting me an all cash officer over 15k above list price. I would hire him again in a heartbeat or recommend him to anyone in the CA Central Calley that is looking to buy or sell their home!
Best,

I was fortunate enough to work with Daniel and his staff  with two separate home purchases.  Throughout both of those processes, the Del Real Group was very helpful, professional and extremely patient with me.  The assistance that I received from them by far made my stressful experience tolerable and ultimately enjoyable.  This group is definitely the best around!!!< /Review>

<Text>My first google review ever will be for this amazing group. Carlos help our family get into our dream home. He was able to provide such great advice and put in a good word for us. And most of us helped up put in the best offer. Our heart were racing as we counted down the seconds before he got his call that our offer was accepted. Even after we settled in carlos came by and when i mentioned an issue with our dishwasher he mentioned buyers protection. I had no idea. Carlos is always available and offer veteran experience that other agents might not have. By the way he handled the stress and pressure we put on him very well. Thank you carlos. Looking forward to working with you again. And will always refer you to any future home buyer/seller that wants an honest hard working agent on their side.</Text>< pictures>

The Del Real Group | PMZ prides itself on getting things done, and if my experience was typical, then their pride is very well deserved. My family needed a retrospective valuation for a house in Modesto, and Daniel Del Real and his team provided a Comparative Market Analysis with remarkable clarity and speed. Their knowledge of the local market, organizational efficiency, technical acumen, and understanding of customer priorities would make me eager to do business with them again.<//review>

Matt from the Del Real Group has been an amazing agent to work with! He was extremely informative and was able to answer all of my questions. He took the time to review a Buyer 101 to help me better understand the process of buying a home including the protections that a buyer is entitled to. Having the process be reviewed so thoroughly definitely puts me more at ease and helps me to feel prepared on my journey in searching for the perfect home. Highly recommend the agents at the Del Real Group, especially Matt!</Review>

I was new to home buying, and have heard horror stories from friends and family about terrible agents. Michael was professional and personal. He never made me feel uncomfortable and helped me every step of the way!
He was extremely honest, upfront, and was able to find us a solid house that fit right in our price range. He was extremely communicative and easy to reach to answer any of our questions at all times. Michael made the nightmare that is finding a house in Modesto a breeze! The Del Real Group should be proud and honored to be working in the presence of realtor greatness that is Michael!</Text></record>

Andy took great care to make sure I found the perfect home for me. He was there for me every step of the way and helped make a difficult time in my life much smoother. I would recommend Andy to anyone looking to sell or buy a home.  It felt like working with a friend and not an agent.<//Review>

Micheal is a great realtor! He was eager to sell our home and was patient as we waited for it to sell. He was able to market our house with beautiful pictures  and got us a top dollar sale! We had  consistent potential buyers and he was able to find the right one to our family home of 18 years! He was flexible and worked with our schedule! We are recommending him to our friends and coworkers!<//Text>

Being a first time home buyer is a very intimidating journey to start, but Matt Foster has made the experience much more enjoyable! He's been very transparent about the costs to be expected and measures put up to protect our investments which made making offers on houses much less stressful. He's also been very quick to respond to all my questions and get me in to view potential homes. I'm excited to work with Matt in the future knowing I have someone that's experienced to help guide me along the process!<//Review>

<Text>The Del Real Group turns what is normally a stressful and confusing home buying/selling process into an easy to understand experience. They have a great way at giving much of their professional knowledge of real estate to their clients, which in turn leaves the client feeling more empowered and confident with their real estate decisions.

He has provided excellent service to help me find homes customized to my needs and expectation.  He is also very professional, experienced and responsive especially when it comes to receiving a request from clients and his willingness to help me find a home.  He is also very friendly and patient and I believe that’s a key to succeed in real estate business.

Me and my wife had a great experience as first time home buyers all thanks to Patricia Servín Martínez. Her experience and patience made all the difference as we were nervous about buying our first home we really didn’t know what to expect but Patty walked us through each step. We wouldn’t go with anyone else, if we decide to purchase another home we will definitely be calling Patricia again.< /Text>

Michael's been awesome to work with! This was second time working with him and he will continue to be my go-to agent in the area. After our inspections we needed to get a large price reduction and we thought there was no way we'd be able to move forward to buy the property. Michael was excellent at negotiating the deal and getting us to the closing table. 10/10, highly recommend!<//Review>

There is a reason that the Del Real Group is the #1 team in the entire state of California and one of the top groups in the country. Daniel and his staff excel at their profession and go above and beyond to serve their customers. It is my great honor and privilege to call Daniel my friend, and I have learned so much about real estate from him and his group. They helped me navigate a tough sellers market as a buyer, and I feel so blessed now to be living in my dream home with their white glove service. Every challenge and obstacle along the way was met with grace and patience. It was even a fun process, although I understand that buying a home and writing offers and not winning bids can generate emotions of stress and fear. We are all busy in our lives, and I feel particularly so as a physician, husband, author, entrepreneur, and father to a young child who is battling cancer. Daniel and his group helped our family get into the right space for us, and made it seamless. I very highly recommend Daniel Del Real and the Del Real Group to serve you in your real estate needs. - Dr. Patrick Tran, MD @drpatricktran on IG, FB, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok</Review>

< Review>
When my father was looking into buying his first home, I knew exactly who to go to. We  went to Don.  It was such a pleasure working with Don. He was so knowledgeable and patient with us during our search.  He was very helpful and responsive to any questions we had.  He took the time to explain the process and even went with us to meet with the lender.  Although my father ended up not purchasing a home at all due to his own personal reasons, Don didn't treat us any different. I ALWAYS refer my family and Friends to The Del Real Group.  If you read this, ask for Don! Tell him Mitzi sent you! You will not be disappointed.< /Review>

Had the pleasure to work with Matt Foster and honestly had a great experience with him. Completely professional but being genuine as well, made me really feel that he had my best interest on his agenda when looking at properties together. Showed true knowledge of the areas which made me really trust him and made the experience easier but on top of that enjoyable. Thank you again Matt!</Text>

I can’t say enough about Del Real Group, they are absolutely AMAZING! We have been working with Don Wright and to say that he is the absolute best would be an understatement. He has helped make the process of purchasing a house so easy and fun! Even when we had to put our purchasing plans on the back burner for a bit, he still checked in on us to see how we were doing and to let us know that he was just a phone call away if we needed him. Now that we are actively looking again, he has been working extremely hard to help us find the right home! No matter what time I text him he is always quick to help and set up showings for us. This place is the real deal and if you are looking to purchase or sell, this is where you should go! Thank you Del Real Group!
Highly recommended!!!!!!< /Text>

Matthew Foster has been a  pleasure to work with! He guided my wife and I through the market trends and provided us with great insight on how to navigate through it all. He has responded quickly to all our inquiries and has been ON IT with scheduling tours. Matthew Foster has made the buying process easy in a time where it is so hard to buy. 100% recommend.</review>

I worked with Jennifer buying my first home. It was an amazing experience. She was very knowledgeable about real estate as a whole and kept me informed every step of the way. Jennifer was communicative any time I had a question and patient with me throughout the entire process. I highly recommend her.</Text>

As a 1st time home buyer who knows absolutely nothing about this process, they made it super smoothe. Learning about this process is like speaking another language. So naturally we had a thousand questions. Really late at night, and  early mornings, no matter the time they were responsive and made you feel like the ONLY client even when your not. I can't thank them enough<//Review>

Daniel was AMAZING. I'm older and this is not my first rodeo, but Daniel made everything so smooth I didn't really have to pay attention to anything. The communication was regular and thorough and I didn't have to ask for it. I was selling from out of the area and Daniel took care of everything for me, from checking the house before it went on to the market, to communicating with the former property managers, to sending someone from the title company to come out to my home during a pandemic--Daniel took care of it all! A true professional.<//Review>

100% recommend this group for all your real estate needs! Their is no question as to why they are a #1 team. They hold each other to high standards to provide each client a 5 star experience but are so humble and genuine. Carlos Gutierrez is definitely one of the greats! Honesty, integrity and transparency are key points to name a few. Keep up the good work guys!</text>

Needed to sell our home as we needed to relocate out of California. I found Del Real Group via Yelp. Sent a message and Daniel contacted me within minutes. Daniel and his team sold my home by the 1st weekend of Open House. The Marketing plan/strategy obviously worked well. Highly recommending The Del Real Group.<//Text>

We went to Del Real Group when looking to buy our first home last August. We went to Carlos Gutierrez to help us with the difficult task of being able to find a home as soon as possible because we were under a timeline to get out of the home we were renting.  Carlos made the process of looking for a home so easy and helped us with any of the terms we didn't know. He also had multiple showings for us to look at when we did go look at homes. He would hand us information sheets on each home and would tell us to take a look at the houses and let him know what we liked about each house and he would give us a few pointers on each house. All I can say is that Carlos was a great agent and we are still happy in the home we choose and we are glad that he helped us put so much! We continue to recommend Carlos with friends and family that are looking to buy !!

Thank you Carlos!<//text>

My husband and I had recently viewed a house with Matt and was pleased with the entire experience. There's been times where real estate agents don't show up at the time they said they would and we'd end up having to wait but that's never the case with the Del Real group! Matt was not only respectful of our time but prepared with all the info we were looking for. There was no pressure and instead were very easy going conversations, I highly recommend this group!< /Text>

I stumbled upon Daniel Del Real and his large team of Del Real Real Estate group few years back at a large event, and I'm so grateful that I did! The team was always on top of everything, reaching out and keeping us in the loop. They always had my interest in mind first, before anything! As a move up client, we were particular what we were looking for to improve our conditions, and Del Real Team was able to bring it to the finish line above (!!!) our expectations, since they have had much more experience and helped us see beyond surface, how amazing the place can be!
Kudos to the whole team at Del Real Group PMZ!<//text>

From the first meeting at the house ( with tenants still living there) I knew he was professional, courteous and knowledgeable. He put the tenants at ease with his fluent Spanish and answered all of my questions. The level of communication during the entire process was excellent, as were his suggestions along the way. When we dropped out of escrow with our 1st buyer,  Andy was immediately ready to get back to work and we were back in contract very quickly. We have bought and sold many properties over the years and this experience was by far one of the easiest. We highly recommend Andy and his team of dedicated professionals, almost wish we had another house to sell!< /Text>< Pics>

I’d like to say that I’ve known Randy for a while now he is a family friend, although I’m not financially ready to purchase a home for myself just yet! All of the advice and knowledge he has brought to social media has put a lot of things into perspective. It gets me very excited to work with him when it is time to purchase a home! He is knowledgeable, passionate, excited in the process, professional and that defiantly reflects the establishment he works for. I haven’t gotten the full experience just yet, but just having a little bit of information about the Del real group makes me excited to work with them!!<//Text>

Patty Servin Martinez made the purchase of our home an amazing experience from beginning to end! She responded to every phone call we made to her and, no matter what time it was, she made herself available to answer our calls and questions.  Patty is very knowledgable, professional, prompt and has a very strong work ethic. Best of all, she never fails to show up with a big smile and a great attitude!  Buying a home can be one of the most important yet stressful decisions people make,  Patty made this experience smooth and stress-free! Thanks Patty!< /text>

I have both bought and sold a house with Patty from this group. She is hands down the best at what she does! I would recommend her to anyone looking and have complete confidence they will be satisfied with her services. She is very knowledgeable, caring  and pays attention to what you are wanting. Definitely choose her and her company you will not regret it.<//Text>

We seriously had the best realtor! Michael was suggestive but not forceful. He took his time and expressed how this is a big decision and wanted to make sure we found the right one. The whole process couldn't have gone any smoother! Some would say we got lucky but in reality we had a great team! We will be forever grateful for the hard work their team put in to make our dream home come true!<//Text>

<review>Jennapher Bell is very knowledgeable, helpful, professional, and personable. As first time home buyers she was reassuring throughout our home buying process.

Jennapher was so personable, she even helped my now fiancé plan his proposal on the day we got the keys to our first home. Jennapher went above and beyond as our realtor.

I would recommend Jennapher to my friends and familythat’s how great our experience was with her.<//review>< resp>

Central valley gem! This group is absolutely amazing they are so genuine and kind. I have referred friends/family to Carlos Gutierrez and heard nothing but praise for  professionalism,  knowledge and sincerity. To top it off they are super involved in the community and giving back to small business as well as clients. If you are ready to buy/sell look no further than this group they are the complete package!< /Review>

I couldn't be happier with the personal care and attention Andy and his team at Del Real Group put into the sale of our home.  He and his entire team went above and beyond to make a difficult process seamless and worry free.  I highly recommend their services and know they'll work just as hard for anyone else as they have for me!</text>

ETA: Since my last review my husband and I have sold our first home with the help of The Del Real Group and I can't say enough good things on how quick, easy, and effortless it was. Daniel knew exactly how to market our niche 2/1 and even took the time to come during photographers session and directed how he felt it would show best. His team went above and beyond and our marketing package looked like something on HGTV! Our home had a full day of showings booked on the first day, and sold within the weekend, with 2 backup offers! ...and when the first buyer came back with unreasonable requests, Daniel advocated for us on our behalf, and rolled with the punches when the first buyer backed out, and lined up our backup offer without a hiccup in our timeline. I truly believe the Del Real Group has the power of teamwork and collaboration with so many talented, experienced professionals that you are bound to succeed!

Daniel & Andy (Indalecio) Del Real have been my family friend for more than 30 years, so when it came time to purchase my first house I knew exactly who to call! They both helped us purchase our first home 10 years ago during the recession, and helped us navigate the competitive market with grace and patience. We found the perfect house that we have enjoyed and called home for a little over 10 years- now that we have outgrown it we recently met with Danny to strategize when to list for our timeline, and what the process will look like overall. Daniel took plenty of time to explain things and make the process easier/give us a clear plan.
Also, over the last 10 years I have recommended the Del Real Group to three different friends to sell or purchase a home because I know these guys to be honest, and trustworthy! All of my friends had a great experience as I knew they would! Can’t recommend this group enough.<//review>

Daniel has guided us and our children through many real estate selling and purchasing transactions over the years. His experience and detailed real estate knowledge are outstanding. His help in marketing and staging have always resulted in a quick sale. His negotiating skill has helped us get the best deals.

Most recently, we were able to sell our property for a significantly higher price than asking.

If you are thinking of buying or selling in the Modesto Turlock area, I would recommend him above all others.</text>

Whenever I would see a home for sale by the Del Real group I often wondered who took the photos and who puts together the marketing videos. After getting to know the Del Real group I found out that the Marketing Manager Fernando is the media person on their team. His marketing skills and creativity are phenomenal.<//text>

<Review>Amanda Stallcup and Carlos Gutierrez were awesome! They did an amazing job every step of the probate process for my dad's house, from facilitating the estate sale to hiring gardeners to clean up the yards. I couldn't have done it without them.

It was a pleasure to work with The Del Real Group, we purchased our first home two years ago and it was so easy. Carlos G. gave us all of our options and showed us a variety of homes. All of them were very kind and helpful, and thanks to Carlos we were able find our dreamed home. I’ve recommended them to all my friends and family looking to purchase real estate.<//text>

<Text>Don was very helpful and understanding of our situation.... within 3 days he already had an offer on selling our house at our asking price and readily helped us look for our new replacement home. The entire experience was easier then I had thought it would be. I would recommend him to anyone, and already have twice.< /Text><Rate>5</Rate>< user>

<Review>Once my husband and I decided to sell our house, we began interviewing realty firms who could assist us in the process.  With the COVID epidemic and shutdowns in place, we had concerns about our timing, the overall strategy, and effects on our sales price.  After speaking with Daniel, we felt he and his Del Rio Team were the way to go.  Daniel’s detailed presentation, sales strategy, and emphasis on the team he worked with instilled trust in his abilities.  We could not be happier with our decision.
Daniel laid out his ideas from the outset and brought in his real estate marketing, social media, and video marketing team together.  He communicated what he needed from us as clients.  He kept us informed during the process and provided excellent advice and insight when appropriate.  Daniel understood the pressures and concerns we had and interjected a calming, reassuring voice when needed.  In the end, the house sold in six days and broke comp records for our area.</Review>< Gmap_id>

We purchased out first home with them a couple years ago and purchased a second home two years ago with Indalecio (Andy). He was very professional and went out of his way to make sure our home buying went as smooth as possible. The team is very professional and welcoming. Definitely recommend our family & friends. Thank you The Del Real Group!</text>

< Review>
Our family purchased our first home with The Del Real Group. Our realtor was the one and only Patty! Things I love about working with Patty and the Del area Group:
1. Patty is super fun to talk to! She’s always full of joy!
2. We told her what we wanted in a home and she never made me feel like it was impossible, she has a can-do attitude!
3.  Buying a house is a complete headache! So many big words and so much to read! So we put our trust in Patty! She has a genuine heart for helping people achieve their homeowner goals. She explained everything and made the process smooth!
4. The Del Real Group doesn’t just take your money and run, they give back! Every year since we bought our home, we were invited to Client Appreciation Events where they would have great entertainment, food, candy, more candy! My favorite time was when they brought a Monkey to the Gallo Center. Yes, you read that correctly, a Monkey!! It was the coolest thing!!
5. From a family of 4 to a family 6, we appreciate Patty being so patient with us and helping us chose our home which we were able to expand our family in!

I can go on and on. Thank you to the best agent Patty &  Del Real Group!!<//Review>

<Review>I am a first time buyer and I had no experience what so ever in how to buy a home or where to even get start. Don was in contact with me from the very beginning , when I first inquired about a house/land I was interested in he looked into it with in a few minutes and got back to me quickly. He gave me great advice on any questions I had , since I had no idea how buying  a house worked, it was such a relief to have someone take the time to truly help me. I appreciate all his hard work and sticking in  there with me ever step of the way.  Thank you so much Don Wright!!<//Review></record>

We had the pleasure of selling our starter home with Andy, he was insightful, professional and friendly. Attentive to our needs and wants. Unfortunately my fiancé and I have very different wants and visions for what we wanted in a home and he must have took us to see 10+ homes and was very patience with the back and forth that my  fiancé and I had going. He answered all our questions and kept us updated through out the process. You won’t go wrong with the Del Real Group, everyone we have met have been sweet, knowledgeable, and professional.< /review>

<Text>The Del Real Group is a very helpful and friendly Realtor company.
We bought our house in May of 2019 our Realtor was Indalecio (Andy) Del Real, Andy showed us many houses and helped us find our new Home and I say Home because since the moment I step foot in that house it’s felt time Home. Andy Del Real accomplished our expectations in our very first house hunting and as we were very satisfied with everything he help us with we always recommend Andy to any family or friends.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Randy was an absolute pleasure to work with as my wife and I were looking for our first home. It was a long process as the economy wasn’t kind to us, but Randy was always there to guide us and answer and questions we had. Not only did we get the house of our dreams, but got to know an awesome person along the way! BBQ invitation to him coming soon!< /Review>

<Review>I highly recommend Carlos Gutierrez for your real estate needs. He did an amazing job getting our house on the market and in escrow in record time! The pictures and video we're amazing and I'm sure between that and Carlos skill in description made our house highly desired. It was a stressful time for us due to the pandemic and buying a home in another state while simultaneously selling our home. Carlos was very attentive to our needs and went above and beyond to answer all our questions including real estate questions on the home we were purchasing in another state. I will be recommending him to all my friends and family.< /Review>< Pics>

I’ve worked with Daniel and his team for multiple transactions. The most recent was selling  my condo to move out of state was a breeze with Daniel and his group.  Never misses a detail. Handles everything from start to finish and makes selling seem like a cakewalk. We had an over asking offer a day after listing.  I recommend him to everyone. He’s trustworthy and hard working.<//Text>

They put in major work on behalf of their client and work miracles in the process by navigating through what can be a very stressful process. They advocate on behalf of what's right for their client and ensure that the process is as transparent and smooth as possible. If they could make my mom feel at ease with a house sell and buy then that is proof enough for me! Would recommend them without hesitation!<//Review>< response>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I worked with an Agent on Daniels team. In January 2020 my wife and I started thinking about selling our home and buying a new home.  A loan agent recommended the Del Real Group. At the time we were getting bombarded by friends recommending real estate agents so I only took the business card. A month later we started interviewing several agents. We were looking for a knowledgeable, full time, ambitious agent. I saw that he is part of the Del Real group. I did not know what they were, but found  the group had a channel online were they interviewed local business owners. I then saw an advertisement they had at Galaxy theather of the team dressed up like the ocean 11 movie. I liked the fact they have roots in the community.

Daniels Del Real group  have some cutting edge marketing techniques that we feel set them apart. They have quite a bit of experience doing it and i liked working  with someone with a team behind them.
We planned on putting the house on the market in March 2020. it took us longer than expected to have the house ready. Then COVID 19 happened! This threw us for a loop. With so much uncertainty in the world we considered pulling the plug on our plans.  The videos produced by the Del Real group during the pandemic really influenced my decision to move forward. They were informative and helped our frazzled nerves. The graphs that Daniel showed that despite the pandemic, the numbers showed that inventory was low and it was a good time to sell and buy. I watched all 3 videos. I was impressed they had a county supervisor on the videos as well. (And boy was Daniel right!, he could see ahead and was guiding his team well at the forefront.) we planned on just selling and renting. But those videos convinced me to sell and buy another home

It took less than 48 hours to get multiple offers OVER asking price!

Even after the sale his team invited us months later to  a drive in movie night The Del Real group organized
Almost 6 months later  am always sharing my experience with my friends, family and co-workers.  Despite 2020 being a terrible year. Daniel and his team have been a glowing bright spot. I plan on using them again in the future.
Feel free to check out the house they sold for me 117 Calaveras ave Modesto.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80905179bdeeba05:0xe492765b79dd0f0e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Don helped us both sell our home and buy our new one. He was always available to us for any questions we had or help we needed along the way, and I always felt like we were a priority for him. Don made our moving process easier than we could have ever expected, and we will definitely use him again if we need a realtor in the future.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Carlos sold three homes for us, and helped us buy one home.  He is by far the most professional and knowledgeable realtor we have met, and we have met many along the way since we have bought and sold many homes. Carlos's personalized attention makes a client feel like they are the only person he is working with, although he is usually juggling many clients (and their issues) at one time.  Carlos and his team are like a well-oiled machine, and are very imaginative when formulating their marketing strategies to highlight the qualities of a home.  Carlos is unflappable and has a unique ability to resolve issues swiftly, while keeping his clients informed and calm.  His contacts are endless, so if something needs to get done, Carlos probably knows somebody who can fix it.  We recently moved out of state and while our California home was up for sale, Carlos took care of overseeing the property, arranged for clean up and repairs, met with repairmen, and handled a myriad of other things in our absence.  Carlos is a humble and quiet family man, and admirably knows how to balance work and family life very well.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80905179bdeeba05:0xe492765b79dd0f0e<//GmapID></record>

<Text>Don Wright is a smart, charismatic, professional agent and we highly recommend him for your real estate needs. I hope sharing our story will convince you this is the agent for you. In January 2020 my wife and I started thinking about selling our home and buying a new home.  A loan agent recommended Don Wright. At the time we were getting bombarded by friends recommending real estate agents so i only took the business card. A month later we started interviewing several agents. We were looking for a knowledgeable, full time, ambitious agent that would market our house well and get us the best price. Don impressed us with his presentation. Don works with the Del Real group and they have some cutting edge marketing techniques that we felt set them apart. We signed with him and Don immediately started helping us with suggestions to improve the marketability of the home. We planned on putting the house on the market in March 2020. it took us longer than expected to have the house ready. Then COVID 19 happened! This threw us for a loop. With so much uncertainty in the world we considered pulling the plug on our plans.  Don reassured us his team had a process in place that would allow them to sell our home even during a pandemic, while also keeping us safe. His calm, confident demeanor made us feel Don would get it done. We called him several times late at night asking questions about repairs or concerns we had. Don always took our calls and always had a great attitude.
The videos produced by the Del Real group during the pandemic were also very informative and helped our frazzled nerves. We also asked Don to help us find a new home as well. We shared we were interested in a new housing development. Don set up a meeting with the real estate agent handling the sales of those homes that same day.  Don came with us and helped us get into contract for a new home on The contingency we sell our home during a certain time frame. We were worried we would not find a buyer in time. Don reassured us he would do his best to get it done. It took less than 48 hours to get multiple offers OVER asking price! We picked a buyer and through we were home free. Unfortunately the buyer got cold feet and backed out of the deal a few days later. Don delivered the news in his usual calm demeanor and assured us we find another buyer. Four days later we again had multiple offers and we accepted an over asking price offer! They requested a 21 day escrow and Don got it done for us. It took 1 month in total to sell our house. We feel blessed we had Don guiding us throughout the process and he was worth every penny.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1591830738451, 'text': 'Thank you for the review Jessie !'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

After my mother passed away, I was tasked with selling the home she lived in for nearly 50 years. It was also the house I grew up in. Needless to say, it was an emotionally difficult process with a few extenuating circumstances. Don Wright of the Del Real Group handled everything. He was professional, responsive, easy-going, and did what needed to be done to get the house sold. We received a full price offer within the first week, and closed the deal in less than 30 days! Thanks Don, you're the best!</Review>

<Text>Navigating the real estate market can be very challenging.  Navigating the real estate market during a pandemic, well, it was absolutely crazy.  With that said, Don Wright was amazing.  He took every twist and turn with absolute confidence.  He was there with the answers and if he didn't have the answer he found it quickly.  This is our fourteenth home purchase and we have never seen a realtor be so focused, so engaged, so caring as Don.  In short, he got the job done in a very crazy market.  Don helped us to get an incredible deal in a sellers market, during a pandemic!  If you are looking for a realtor you can trust, one that will work hard for you to get into your next home, then look no further.  Don Wright is the realtor for you!

<Text>If I could give Daniel Del Real 10 stars, I would do so without hesitation. He is the most knowledgeable, reliable, trustworthy, efficient, patient, and impressive realtor I've ever worked with. Every question I had was answered in full not only with with detailed explanation, but also in a timely manner. Every email, text, and phone call was returned. He made the selling of my parents' house almost a joy. Very few have the work ethic of Daniel and his team. Please look no further, Daniel Del Real is exactly who you are looking for in an agent.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This is  our fourth time hiring the Del Real Group.  We so appreciate Daniel and his entire team.  This sale was different.  We had to bob and weave through the waves of the Covid-19.  Daniel had a great plan coming in and we added our ideas too.  We emptied and cleaned the house.  And made it accessible to whoever wanted to see it, one at a time of course.  Daniel and his team developed incredible marketing with pictures, videos, phone calls, postcards and social media.    The house went on the market and a little over a week later we had four competing offers.  We took the offer that was the best and over asking.  Within 28 days we closed and recorded.  It was a great experience.  Daniel was always there to answer our questions and calm us down when needed.  lol   Thank you Daniel for your expertise, your kindness and your drive for excellence.  Doesn't come any better than Daniel Del Real and the Del Real group.</text>

I want to thank Carlos Gutierrez for being so helpful. He was always quick to answer any questions I had through the entire process. Carlos went above and beyond to help my family and I find our perfect home. I am thankful for his honesty and knowledge about the neighborhoods for all the houses he showed us, and being able to work around my schedule. Carlos always made availability to show us houses, he always insisted we took our time seeing the entire house. I can honestly say I did not feel any pressure into buying a house I did not absolutely love. He wanted to make sure we bought a house we loved and we were happy with. Carlos is an amazing realtor and I will definitely refer him to all my family and friends looking to buy or sell a house.</Text>

Mr. Del Real answered all of my questions patiently and promptly.  I never had to wonder if i had slipped to the bottom of his busy schedule.  I was never left to doubt if I was a priority.  I had unique and specific needs and he rose to the challenge and mastered every one of them within a very timely matter.  I could not be happier with this company. I highly recommend Daniel and The Del Real Group to anyone who needs trustworthy assistance walking through their real estate season.  I wish I could award this review with 100 stars!  Thank you, Daniel Del Real, for everything you and your company have done to make me and my family happy and ready for our new journey in life.< /review>< UserId.>

<Text>This is coming from a first time home buyer with lots of questions. The Del Real Group (Andy) was super helpful. He was knowledgeable and patient. Easy to work with. Good communication, would reply promptly, even to text messages! He is also very organized which made the whole transaction smooth and effortless. I would definitely recommend him to family and friends and will use him again in the future.</Text>< pictures>

Daniel had a thorough understanding of the market and guided us appropriately. His demeanor was very positive and he knew when to press us to take action.  He is honest and direct, and helped keep us honest along the way!  From the onset, Daniel made himself available and had a professional kickoff meeting to ensure he understood our expectations and timeline.  Initially, we thought we knew exactly where we wanted to live, but Daniel encouraged us to think outside of our barriers. Thanks to Daniel's advice we ultimately purchased our dream home in an area we didn't expect. Could not be any happier!  What's more, we had the privilege of getting to know Daniel as an outstanding person.  Highly recommend Daniel and the Del Real Group if you are buying/selling your home, hands down the best agent in the Valley.< /text>

Being a first time home buyer can certainly be an emotional experience but he was there for all the ups and downs and didn’t let us give up hope on finding our perfect home. He went above and beyond even when he was out of town to help us make an offer on our now home that we love to make it happen the same day!!!  It didn’t take long at all for us to get back an acceptance. We are so greatful to Andy and couldn’t have done it without him!!!!💕 Thank you Andy and your investment in us!<//Review>< Pics>

I worked with Don on 3 transactions because I believe he is dedicated  to making his customers happy and is an overall trustworthy person. I've bought and sold homes for the past 20 years and never have I seen someone go the extra mile for me. I will continue to refer him and the Del Real Group because you all care about your customers and not just the sale! Thank you</Review>

This is a team, and they will go the extra mile for their clients. I really do not believe we could have done this without them. Thank you to Daniel and his team. You are the best.

Andy was a pleasure to have as my real estate agent. He always responded promptly, offered great advise and resources. We sold our house the first weekend that it was on the market and at the same time he helped us buy our new house. I thought it was going to be complicated but Andy made it so easy. Thank you so much for everything!<//text>

Every single individual we worked with while in the process of buying our home, my husband and I could not believe how great everyone was. Every company that The Del Real Group utilized and recommended we use during this process made this so easy and stress free. We were extremely stressed because we have heard so many horror stories with buying a house. Our experience was quick, easy and painless. Even after we closed on our home, our realtor Daniel Del Real still reached out to us and even helped us with an issue we had with our warranty while he was on his way out of town. The Del Real Group treats you like family and doesn't stop until everything is settled. We love The Del Real Group!< /text>

<text>i sold my house through Daniel Del Real Dan and his Team truly helped through this difficult and stressful process. He took all the burden off me and my family and closed 2 weeks faster then we expected. He invests a lot in his team and you can tell his whole team is well equipped with knowledge and their response times are amazing. I have never worked with someone so professional as his team. Thank again for making the sales of our home come true and helping our family through the process. I have already recommended you to all of my family and friends

As first time homebuyers, Andy was such a patient and accommodating realtor to us. From our first meeting in his office, he made us feel comfortable and shortly our relationship turned less into a business and more into a friendship. He answered any questions we had when it came to choosing a home with a sincerely honest opinion and helped us buy a home we loved. He also let us into his personal life by sharing about his travels with his wife and his journey on training for his first triathlon. His whole team was there for us when we wanted to check out a specific home and his team was also behind the scenes right when we finally got the keys to our house. We were surprised with their signature bow on the front door and Andy even gave us cake and sparkling cider (keeping in mind that we don’t drink alcohol) to celebrate! We cannot thank Andy and his team enough for making the whole process of buying a home so easy!< /text>

<Text>We initiated our search for a realtor with the Dave Ramsey Endorsed Local Provider (ELP) program and Andy’s name rose to the top.  We liked the way he took an analytical approach to the housing market, using data to inform strategies and decisions.  We asked for advice about selling our home; he gave it.  We started the process and he was there to give support and feedback whenever we asked.  We asked for a referral for handyman; we got it.  We asked for a referral for a roof inspection; we got it.  We asked for names for house cleaning; we got it.  All support businesses, like the title company, for example, were chosen strategically to help with our particular situation.  We asked for a timeline of just what he would do for us to accomplish our goal of selling our home in a timely way at a reasonable price; we got it.

We did our part preparing our home for sale.  He did his part arranging an amazing videographer to film our home, and get it listed and promoted.  An associate ran the open house, but Andy was here the following Monday with bids for us to review.  He made the process doable.  Even when my nerves were on edge, he responded in measured tones to reassure.  He was steady, knowledgeable, forthright and committed.  He made sure we were covered, but even checked in while on a scheduled family cruise during a crucial stage of the sale negotiations. Having a competent realtor like Andy made the process of selling our home a straightforward transaction.  Having him run interference for us at every turn was worth every penny.  We would certainly recommend Andy as someone to hire for your real estate needs.  Thank you, Andy.</Text>< Date>

< Review>
My husband and I are first time home buyers and I thought that because of that our process of purchasing a home would be slow and take forever but I was wrong it was actually verry fast and easy. We never had any delays within the process due to any of the del real group members which is greate because it really showes there commitment  I also really appreciate our real estate agent Andy for kindly helping us through and explaining everything we did not understand and repeating him self with a verry kind attitude and I absolutely appreciate his time he was willing to work around our work schedule which is greate we didn't have to miss work or get off early for any reason overall we highly appreciate all of you and keep putting those verry pretty red bows on the front doors of every home purchase it's just a a verry pretty touch that gets you excited when you see your home and realize you have accomplished that verry big goal. Thank you<//Review>

I have bought and sold 10 houses in 3 different states and the Del Rio group’s marketing strategy and their understanding  of the online customer who is searching for homes is above any I have seen in the real estate business.</Text>

If you are looking for great, quality agents then the Del Real Group is for you. After attempting with multiple different agents to find a home, the Del Real Group was the best out of all! They are extremely professional, responsive and really show genuine care for their clients. Buying a home was very hectic but Carlos and Daniel did the best that they possibly could to make it as smooth as possible. Very thankful for this group in helping me get into my very first home! Great communication and great tactics!<//Text>

We submitted offers on multiple locations and the right one finally worked out for us, because of Don. We were not the first offer accepted, but because Don urged the seller's agent to keep our offer as a backup we were the first call for the home we really wanted when the original offer fell through! For each offer we submitted, Don was there to review all of the details and assist us in making the best possible offer on the homes and ones that we only truly felt comfortable with. As this was our first home-buying process, we had a lot to learn and Don taught us a ton! We feel very grateful and lucky to have had Don by our side through this process and words can't express how thankful we are to him.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>I love this place..... But today was horrible. I didn not get the shape i wanted I had to tell her like 3 times to fix it and it still was not right. She fixed a nail and made it croocked after i told her she said she would fix it but did not. Not happy. Not at all her name was Emily plus she was not to happy about me having to tell her to fix my nails which in the end she did not. I had originally asked for Chou but confused her name for Emily. Chou is the best nail tech. Will only go with her now. $50something not well spent only good thing is I love my pedicure. Nails are all kinds of shape but cofin.</Review>< Pictures>

They are rude and charge way too much. I took my son for an ingrown toe nail and specified to them just the BASIC PEDICURE. apparently she asked him questions and he did not understand and noted his head. So they charged me extra. I also heard a young girl upset because they charged her the most expensive pedicure and she did not ask for it. The owner did not care. This poor girl paid 154 for pedicure and short nails. Its really outrages! I will never return. Also, when I asked for them to break down the price the lady got upset, I'm like lady its my money I'm paying, I just want to know exactly what your charging me.<//text>

THE WORST NAIL SALON.
They discriminate if you do not speak English. They leave you to wait for 3 hours till they want to help you and then turn you away for a service you are willing to pay for. So many nail salons and not once have experienced such distasteful customer service. Only services I was hoping for was acrylic nail removal and manicure since the city is shutting down again but somehow that was either too difficult or they blatantly wanted to be rude for no good reason. NEVER AGAIN.<//review>

I got acrylic fill done by Emily and she is the best! She takes her time to make sure you get exactly what you want. I needed my eyebrows done as well and she mentioned that she does eyebrow wax for $8! Overall I am super impressed and happy with their services today and will definitely be coming back in a few weeks for my next fill. Loved it!</review>< pics>

Prices increased and quality decreased. Went in on a Sunday for full set. By Tuesday a nail fell off while typing on a keyboard. By Thursday another nail broke off as my nail swiped the side of the table. I brought it up to the owner and she angrily said, "the nail don't fall off by themself!" Another customer came in on Tuesday with a broken nail. She was also there the same Sunday I got my nails done. What a disappointment. They've lost a 5 +year customer< /text>

< Review>
Incredible service! And to think I never really noticed this sweet gem. The staff has great service, they are friendly and are customer service based, and if your a DTLA native then you know how important that really is. Often times salons are packed and staff are rude unless your willing to pay a pretty penny for a pedicure on Melrose (I’ve been there too....not that great. Trust me). This was my first time going and it most certainly won’t be my last. All smiles.</Review>

All they do is run the tools under water (no soap) and use it on the next customer. I have seen them do this in my last 3 visits through the years. When you complain about it, they pour alcohol on them. Nail files aren't cleaned between customers. I usually go to another place that sanitize their tools with a small sanitizing oven. I feel much more secure that the tools are clean there than at Model Nails. They also aren't so attentive to each customers. If you have a little bit of an ingrown nail, don't expect them to trim it because they don't. They constantly change their employees, don't expect to have a regular person. The only regular persons are the owner and the guy that does acrylics. Service is okay if you are in a rush or have no other options, but not my top choice.</text>< Name>

<text>I got here after work because it's so close. Emily always does a great job on my lashes & nails. She's a real one. She won't over charge you because she can or for every little thing. If you are in the area check her place out. Ask for Emily. She gets busy so be prepared to wait because she doesn't do appts. 🙂</text>< Pictures>

I've now done all of the rooms here and they're all amazing. Very thoroughly themed with sights and sounds that make you feel like you're truly in a haunted house or a creepy cabin. Containment Breach is an excellent introduction to escape rooms and the other two offer a great challenge while still being a lot of fun. The game masters are fantastic clue givers. Highly recommend all of their rooms. Overall one of the best experiences in the Sacramento area!< /text>

<text>Literally the best escape ever! Our game host Coleen, was super informative and extremely helpful when needed through our experience. It was so exciting, we wanted to jump straight to another room if we could have! The atmosphere and design is top notch and such amazing attention to detail and design let alone the puzzles were challenging, fun, and leaving us eager to find the next clue! We will definitely be returning with more brain power! Awesome way to spend my Birthday!<//text>< pics>

So fun!  I have done two of their rooms; Whispering Halls and Skull Witch. Didn’t make it through Skull Witch but solved Whispering Halls!  Very thoroughly themed rooms and their production value is stellar!  Made me feel like I was a real haunted place with sound effects, lighting, and vintage pieces throughout! Amazing experience and would highly recommend it!!< /review>

Oh my gosh this place was so much fun. We did containment breech and it was so detailed. Every step was fun and challenging. The hour went so fast. The hints were helpful but not giving it away either. The whole place is themed out to max. They have a party room and I'm thinking birthday!< /text>

Very fun puzzle. Containment breach was the right amount of challenging. The workers were really nice. My friend was running late from a crazy day at work, but they still let us enjoy the game!< /Review>

My siblings and I came here for the first time, and it was awesome! We’ve never done an escape room before and apparently we picked the HARDEST room, lol. The “Skull Witch”. It was super fun, realistic sound and visuals, and our Game master Frank was super chill and friendly. I definitely recommend that everyone come here! It’s definitely challenging but whether you finish or not, it’s really exciting and the spooky ambiance is lit. I’m going to maybe have some guacamole now.<//text>

How FUN! We had such a great time at Enchambered in the Whispering Halls room. Yvonne was our game moderator and she was awesome. We ended up escaping with 41 seconds left. Super challenging, exciting sound effects and really interesting story and set up! Very clean, too - Covid safe. We didn’t have any crossover with other guests. We’ll definitely be back to Enchambered again - this is the BEST escape room experience we’ve had. Worth the money for sure! Thanks Yvonne!</text>

Colleen was an amazing game master, when we got stuck she helped us along the way! We loved it so much we are going back again tonight to try a other room. Highly recommend 👌
We went back to do another room this evening, & Jenifer was our game master this time. She was super sweet and helped us complete our mission! We will definitely be back for more fun soon👍<//Review>

Our Game master Jennifer was awesome!!! Did the escape room with my man and realized we’re not meant for each other. Communication is the key to everyone’s relationship.  I highly suggest coming here with your significant other. For just $35 you can determine your relationship status. Current status: Complicated.... damn auto correct. I meant in a relationship 😂<//Text>

<text>We did the Whispering Halls room and it was our favorite room we have done so far at Enchambered. Liam was an awesome game master who gave us hints when we needed - he didn’t directly give us the solution which was appreciated and gave us hints on what to look for. It was definitely a very challenging room and we needed everyone working together - definitely need a minimum of 5 people for it. Overall great experience at Enchambered and looking forward to new rooms/games to try next since we have now done all 3 current rooms.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1620617792395, 'text': 'Wow thank Carl!

<user_name>Tim Mascara< /user_name><Review>This escape room company was wonderful! We did the Whispering Halls room and the set was so well done. I’ve never been in a room like that before. The puzzles were nicely spread out and varying levels of complexity. I always like a room that has enough puzzles to not bottleneck the group too badly. This gives enough time for people to think about a puzzle while others are working on a different one. This also helps with replay value because there were puzzles I never got to see the solution to because I was in another room. So I would easily come back and do this one with a group and try different puzzles.

I also have to say I love rooms that actually make you feel transported to another world. A lot of places fail at this by the ceiling being basic tiles. Even if they are painted it gives away the feel. This room didn’t have that at all.

And the way they did the hint system was genius!

I would highly recommend coming to this company if your looking to do a room. I plan on coming back to try the other two rooms eventually!</Review>< GmapID>

<Text>Definitely the best, most sophisticated escape room I've been at yet, and I've been to 3 others in the Sacramento area. Great technical, sound and light  effects. We did the Whispering Halls experience with a girls birthday party of  mostly 10 year olds. Some were slightly younger or older. 2 of our little girls in our group were a bit scared - but that's just shows again how well the rooms were done. Staff was really nice too! Everyone had a blast (even the scared ones afterwards thought it was so much fun)!< /Text>< Pictures>

We went here on spring break vacation with our daughter and a friend. The staff were super helpful in preparing us for the room and the puzzles were fun and challenging. A scary doll appeared and the squeals of excitement and fear made us all laugh. We kept turning the doll different directions to face the kids. It was definitely a good time and would recommend to anyone looking for some goofing off and fun!<//text>

First time back at enchambered since they have reopened and it was awesome! Unity was an amazing game keeper for us and you could tell she was closely following our progress to give us any hints we might need. As a seasoned group of escape room players there were puzzles we have not seen before, and we were excited that we escaped in time! Enchambered is like the Disneyland of escape rooms they do an amazing job from the puzzles to the decor. I can not wait to come back!< /text>

The online escape rooms are by far the best we’ve tried. They are so very well done and so entertaining!  I marvel at the creativity some gifted people have to put together such intuitive, thoughtful, artistic activities! They’re great for dates, friends hanging out with friends, family hanging out with family . What a great way to connect when we’re physically apart.<//Review>

<review>I've done all of their online escape rooms. Really, really enjoyed Alone Together and Together Apart. The most recent one had a cool feature to share objects you find with the other player, but the puzzles were a lot less intuitive. Overall, though, very nice to have an online escape room option!!!< /review>< pics>

They're great about sanitizing the rooms and supplying sanitizer for people to use throughout the building. I've been there 3 times now and I've enjoyed it every time! Definitely looking forward to going again. Thank you for the great experience, Unity!</Text>

This post is from the Grandmother, I am so glad I booked this for my granddaughter 17th birthday, she was very happy and excited to do a escape room.  It was truly fun and it was a good experience in working together as a group. I would suggest everyone should do it once in their life time.  This place was marvelous and the gentleman that started us on the journey was nice and very good at his job, I really do like to thank him.  I will highly recommend this place to other.</Review>

We had an amazing time at this escape room!  By far , it’s the best one we’ve ever done (4 previous at various places).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  At game start, you feel as if you've entered the Disney Haunted Mansion, their set up and staging is that good.  Just 5 of us attempted Whispering Halls, but having one or two more people would’ve been ideal to tackle the sheer number of locks and puzzles incorporated into this design.  Though we ran over the allotted 60 minutes by 1 minute and asked for about 4 hints along the way in order to escape, we were able to solve almost everything on our own, which felt satisfying.  We were never frustrated and there was PLENTY for us to do.  Difficulty level was spot on and the game consultant was great!  Fright factor not suitable for under 10.  Great Covid activity - we were appreciative of their mask requirements and cleaning processes.  10 out of 10 for a medium difficulty!!  Not sure if we’d come back to try the easier one (would it feel too easy after tackling WH?) or if we’re clever enough to attempt the most difficult one.  Maybe??  Would love another medium difficulty option from Enchambered!< /review>

The game really got us to think, so their suggestion of team work was very helpful. We had unlimited hints, they would call to guide us towards the right decision when we were close. The light and sound effects really got a few screams and scares from us.</Review>< Pictures>

Out of this world! The set design in Enchambered's rooms is super immersive and feels like you've stepped into a movie set--and you're the main character. Lots of moving parts and surprises to be found. Puzzles were fun and interesting, with a lot of different types to explore. Staff (particularly Uniti, thank you for everything!!) was INCREDIBLY helpful and kind, really going out of their way to care for us and chat with us like old friends. Totally recommend.<//Review>

The room was great.  We had 4 in there trying to solve it.  We were down to the wire and didn't figure out the last clue.  The employee guiding our journey, Andrew, was great.  We would like to go back and try one of the harder rooms with a more full squad.  If you're considering doing an escape room for the first time, don't pass this place up!< /text>

This is the best escape room in town! If you want to have some good family fun then this is place to come. I have been to an escape room in a different state and this escape room blows that other place out of the water. The rooms were well decorated and VERY immersive. Great sound effects and very well placed clues to really exercise your mind. Also the staff was amazing and extremely helpful. The whole place was amazing. My wife, sister, sister in law, and me all had an amazing time even though we did not beat the escape room even with the help of the staff lol. If you are scared about the virus no need to be here because they sanitize everything after you use it even the pens. Basically if you are looking to go have some fun come to enchambered escape room. THEY ARE THE BEST IN TOWN HANDS DOWN!<//Text>

This was my first ever escape room and I'm officially hooked!  There were only three of us so we only got about 50% done and didn't "escape" but that just taught me I need to try and have more people...it was so fun!<//review>

My husband and I have done >100 rooms, and Enchambered is the cream of the crop in terms of puzzle quality and production value! Skull Witch is our favorite.</text>

First time doing a room and the excitement of my daughter made it all that better. We were greeted by the kindest staff and the girl helping us was awesome. We had so much fun and even though our family of 7 got a little bossy with each other it was a great time!!<//text>

I have never done one of these, so I had my doubts.  However, after the experience I am going to do more.  Lots of fun trying to figure out the clues to get beat the game.  Very challenging and the staff was really great< /text>

Totally forgot I could put words in a review. Yall I had doubts about escape rooms, cause ya know....doing puzzles? Using my brain? Not gonna lie I dont really use much of both. So when I offered my friends who all have never done one before to help me, I didnt think we were gonna do much. HOWEVER! I have never felt so much adrenaline after solving a puzzle, and when you do solve one....wow. one could almost compare it to someone saying they are proud of you. The puzzles here were so much fun, the rooms were so freaken detailed. AND TBH HOW DO THEY THINK OF THESE PUZZLE?! The staff were so kind to us too. When asking for hints they kept in character while being super helpful. And though we weren't able to solve it without help, we were able to see the room to the end which was such a blast. We all will def go back again to try the other rooms. Until then, I'll hopefully have used my chrome dome enough to not need hints >:^)) thank you again enchambered staff! And to anyone who reads this, yall gotta try this one if you are trying for the first time or looking for something to dust off the old brain gears.< /Text>

Back in May 2020, I discovered Enchambered via the internet, through their virtual escape room "Alone Together". I had been searching for a game to play with a friend who lives across the state. "Alone Together" was the perfect way for my friend and I to connect during a time that has been particularly isolating and lonely. After playing that first virtual escape room, I was hooked. Enchambered soon went on to release "Together Apart", as well as their newest creation, "Together at Heart". All three of these games have been top-notch. Each room has been progressively more challenging than the last; all packed with details and clever puzzles that will tickle your brain. Not only are the games masterpieces themselves, but the customer service of their employees is first-class, as well. Once it is safe to travel,  I plan to visit Sacramento and make a day (or two!) visiting Echambered and playing their in-person escape rooms. Thank you, all the way from the East coast, for being such a wonderful company. I look forward to more creations from this business in the future!</text>

<review>AMAZING!!! I felt like Sherlock Holmes and more. I can’t imagine anything else out there compares.  The Whispering Halls is top notch, amazingly difficult with a passing rate of 15% and we were hot.  There were 8 of us, 2adults, 4 teenagers and 2 kids (9&11). I was blown away how the teens communicated and worked together in solving the clues. I don’t care what the teachers said about these kids, they are awesome!! Thank you Enchambered!!!<//review>< Gmap_id>

Enchambered has the best escape rooms, they do such a great job with the rooms and puzzles. The staff is friendly and really do a good job promoting the full experience. The rooms themselves are so intricate, and the puzzles are so fun to figure out. It is very hands on, and there are many unique and interesting things to find within the rooms. I’ve done all three rooms, and each is so well done. The skull witch was the most challenging for my group, whispering halls was probably the most fun, and the containment breach was also pretty challenging but still super fun. Would definitely recommend any of these rooms to anyone looking for a fun time and a team building experience!</review>

With over 45 rooms under my belt I can safely say that Enchambered is one of the best ER companies I have been to.

We did Containment Breach with 8 people (6 of them were beginners) and we were all hootin and hollering and having a grand ole time. We can't wait to do the other two rooms< /Review>

I had an absolutely amazing time again!!! This was my second time going and brought my nieces and nephew. The staff was incredibly friendly. I continue to be impressed with the props and puzzles and felt fully immersed in the room. I highly recommend this escape room and can't wait to go back. .<//text>

The staff at Enchambered were super patient and professional. We booked a special event and my group was running behind by 15 to 20 minutes. I was very stressed about it, but they did a great job at not adding to the stress.

In the end, our company event was a blast and everyone had a great time. We really appreciated it!

This is my favorite escape room in Sacramento...quite possibly the world!</Text>

Great place!

It passes the vibe check! First time doing an escape room, went with 5 friends and 3 random strangers. It was fun! The puzzles werent too hard and weren't too easy. We finished with 44 seconds left!!! Felt amazing to win at the last minute! I would recommend going here!

Will probably come back and try a different room!</text>

Their rules on hints (have as much hints as you need) allow beginner groups to still have fun if they get stuck. The new people in our group loved it so much, they asked me when we could do another.

<text>It was a lot of fun and very addictive. We almost made it out. The only thing I wish I would have considered is a difference in this and all the other escape rooms. The ones I’ve been to so far have only had the “keys” or “clues” found to solve one problem or puzzle. I was surprised that we used some of the objects twice. Or multiple times. Once I figured it out it became easier.  I hope that makes sense. All in all it was one of my favorite rooms so far and definitely top 2 for sure. The attention to detail was fantastic and we all had a great time!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

After trying a few other escape room facilities, this one is definitely the best! It’s engaging, has a wide variety of clues, and has a great ambiance. The hosts and game masters are great at explaining the “how-to” and setting up the story lines.
We’ve done all three rooms they currently have to offer and hope they add some more soon!< /Text>

<Review>Some friends and I booked the Skull Witch room and had such a great time! The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the room staging and puzzles were so impressive. I loved the swampy, voodoo vibe of the room! The entire facility has such a rad ambiance. We were told this room is more advanced than the others, and it was definitely challenging, but we had a blast even though we didn't end up unlocking everything. I would definitely recommend and plan to return to try out the othere rooms :)<//Review>< Pics>

My fiance and I have done over 50 rooms together up and down California and some out of state.

We've only done Containment Breach and was absolutely floored with their fun puzzles, great lighting and set design. It was also one of the best games we've played when paired with a group of strangers. After hearing that Containment Breach was their WEAKEST room only cements the fact that we need to go back.</Text>

<review>The special effects were great and really scary. I love their use of technology. I love the use of the space and the props were life-like. The hosts were fantastic. They allowed us to ask questions about the room and things we may have missed. This was well worth the money and time.<//review><user>102494634046736297362<//user>< Time>

We played The Whispering Halls with a full room and made it out with something like 16 minutes to spare.  It didn't feel short though.  The ambiance and production value are really amazing.

There were so many puzzles and things to do that there is definitely replay value. I could play again and focus only on puzzles I didn't focus on last time and have a brand new experience. Maybe twice more.

This is not your standard "find the key" escape game.  Puzzles here are VERY well thought out and are immensely satisfying to work through. If I were to suggest a viable, bare minimum group size for this room it would probably be 5.

TL;DR:

Atmosphere:
Ambient noise encourages better communication, and effects are awesome. Basically Disneyland.
9/10

Puzzle difficulty:
Makes you think and work together, but pretty intuitive. No real logical leaps.
8/10

Puzzle creativity:
A fantastic mix of puzzle types, none of which are stale. Some I've never seen.
10/10

Hint system:
Delivers. We did get one hint for a puzzle we had already solved though.
7/10

Staff:
Friendly, inviting, and fun.
10/10

Can't wait to return!</Text>

<Review>I love that every room in this location (even the lobby and waiting rooms) are decorated. It has a great atmosphere that tells you, "yes you're at our Escape Rooms, yes we're gonna get into character and have fun with it". I've done Whispering Hills and Skull Witch and can say that both of these rooms were well worth the visit. They're decorated from top to bottom, the puzzles are unique from other Escape rooms I've done, and the staff has fun with it the whole time. Great experience and I suggest it for anyone who's looking for a fun group activity.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>From the minute you walk in the door you feel like you are at Disneyland.  The sound and the atmosphere resembles the Tower of Terror of old.  The rooms very immersive and so much fun to play.  We have done almost 30 Escape rooms and this is our absolute favorite.  Thanks to the owners for creating such a magical experience.  Good Job!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics><user>116923750632370739721</user><Date>1578501580970<//Date>< resp>

Amazing place! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff was warm, welcoming and helpful. Our group did the Whispering Halls, difficult but executing this phenomenon with a little over a minute to spare. Creative, scary, loved the different rooms and creative story line. Our guide, Zeb was amazing and helpful. I would recommend this place to all my friend.< /Text>

I've been to Enchambered three times and have experience all three escape rooms and they are so much fun. The props and clues are so elaborate it really makes you get into the story of each room. Our groups had so much fun each time and we talk about it for hours after. Highly recommend this place.< /text>

Came here for a company team builder. We did the whispering halls room. I wasn't expecting to like it but I had a lot of fun. It took us literally to the last minute to complete. They did a great job with decor and sound effects. I highly recommend this place< /review>

A group of 8 of us did the Containment room and escaped with 8 mins left! It was the easiest out of the 3 rooms here but the puzzles were still challenging enough to be fun. The room was well-decorated and stuck to the theme. The staff is friendly. We had an awesome time!< /Text>

<review>I had a great time at Enchambered this past Saturday. In my escape room, I had to face the Skull Witch but things didn't go so well for me and I lost my soul! The room was fantastic and the puzzles had a great level of difficulty, great as in amazingly well designed and pleasantly detailed and complicated in design and planning. Kudos!

This was an awesome experience! We did Containment Breach with 3 adults, a 16 year old and a 12 year old. We all had a good time. There are plenty of puzzles at all levels to keep everyone busy and engaged in the game. Our game hosts were fun and super friendly to our first-timer confusion and we all left wanting to do another one!</Review>

We had an absolute blast. Their elaborate decor and attention to detail really help us get into the game. All of the staff members are amazing, helpful, and friendly. Theresa and Connie were incredible and so accommodating to our requests. Such a great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area! They also give discounts to military/first responders!</review>

I went with a group of 4. It was our first escape  had room, and we had a great time. It's an immersive experience with thoughtful puzzles, story, and excellent production design.

One complaint: Enchambered currently offers 3 rooms (easy, medium, hard), however, the degree of difficulty for the room we chose (Skull Witch) wasn't listed on the website. A simple update on the website listing degree of difficulty would prevent newbies, like my group, from accidentally picking the hardest of the rooms (Skull Witch is very enjoyable, but also very difficult).

We plan to return to tackle one of the easier rooms in the future.

Overall: wonderful experience.</Text>

Had a blast tonight at Enchambered.   Even though we weren’t able to solve every puzzle and get every clue we did really well and had so much fun doing it!   It’s surprising how fast an hour goes by when you’re concentrating on finding and figuring out clues!
Great time and staff.  I recommend it!</Text>

My family and I decided to come here for my 27th birthday! We wanted to do an activity together that would require teamwork and was a bit out of the box. Let me tell you, Enchambered delivered on exactly that. We had so much fun in the Skull Witch escape room that we continue to talk about it and joke about our experience together the entire rest of the weekend! The room was very well decorated and very much "in scene" I appreciated all the small details and quirks about the room. I have done 2 escape rooms before with other companies but this place by far was the best experience I've had! We will definitely be back with a bigger group so we can check out the other escape rooms they have.</text>

What a great place and awesome experience!  Super friendly and on-it staff, they even called before our appt. to give us a heads up over parking since an event was going on at a neighboring business.  Very clean, professional, fun storyline, and challenging but fun puzzles. Highly recommend!</Review>

In a group that used the skullwitch. Room. Lot's of clues to find and extraneous information to sort through. Problems were tough to solve. Set filled with excellent props and very theatrical. Employees helpful. Better than other escape rooms we've visited in other cities.</Text>

I've only tried one room so far (and was not able to complete it in time) but it was great. This place definitely has one of the best designed escape rooms that I've been to so far. The decor and atmosphere is excellent and some of the puzzles were quite impressive on a technical level with how they were operated. I'm not sure if all of the rooms are like this but the one that I did even had like connected rooms that were unlocked once you solved certain puzzles. Really cool experience overall!<//Review>

This was our first room at Enchambered, many of my friends had recommended this place and we finally got a chance to go. my family and I did whispering halls and the room itself was Amazing!! it felt like they really paid attention to detail and atmosphere when they made this room. not even  going to lie I was scared...but our game master Frank was incredible.
we had a pregnant woman in our group and he made sure to let her know privately how to not get caught up in the jump scares (which she really appreciated) he was very re assuring and encouraging every time he called. we will definitely be coming back to finish the rest of the games.<//Text>

<Text>Was a great experience for a novice Escape Room player!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who has never done an escape room before.  The staff was very helpful at explaining the concept of the escape room and giving us the fundamentals on how to navigate through the room (such as, how to open certain locks and whether they follow the one item one puzzle rule).  The immersion was also fantastic, they did a great job designing the rooms with decorations, lights, and sounds.  Will definitely be coming back sometime.< /Text>< pictures>

Fantastic experience! Take note - when they say the Skull Witch room is the hardest room.. it really is. We didn't quite finish it, but had a delightful experience. The set, props, and effects are A+ and the staff is fun, friendly, and helpful. Would definitely visit again.</Review>

Super fun and accessible to all ages. There's a phone in the room you can pick up anytime to ask for a hint, so you don't get too frustrated. Everyone working there was super nice and they offered us sodas/waters for when we finished, since we were celebrating a birthday :) Will definitely be back!<//Review>

<Review>Communicate effectively with Deaf group we are.. puzzles are challenged well. So many tricks to do... we had so much fun! We definitely will come back for other rooms.

One suggestion, visual hints instead of coming in to hand in hints.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

We did the Skull Witch experience, and it was amazing! This was my first escape room, and we got so close to finishing! I am thrilled to return here in a few months when the Tomb Raider room opens!! The staff were amazing, special shout outs to our Game Master Kevin, who we (unfortunately) did not save in time.</review>

<Text>I’ve done all three rooms at Enchambered and have had a blast every time! The game masters are all enthusiastic, the extra details in the room really help create the right atmosphere, and the puzzles are all fun and challenging. Their easiest room, Containment Breach, is doable for beginners while still being enjoyable for veteran escapees, and their other two rooms are a good challenge that definitely would’ve stumped my team if we hadn’t asked for hints. I’ve done escape rooms at 3 or 4 places and this one is by far my favorite.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I can't say enough good things about this venue. I have finished 2 escape rooms at this same location and each time the service was excellent. I was lucky enough to have a gentleman named, Nick to help us along the way. He was amazing in establishing the ambience as well as managing the excitement of 2 rowdy pre-teens. The escape room itself was incredible, but the customer service made the experience most memorable. 5 star service and a 5 star experience!<//review>< pics>

Just left the escape room for my buddy's bachelor party. We did the scientists lab room and had a blast. It was cool to see everyone use their strengths. Colbey was our guide and tips guy and was awesome setting us up and dropping hints. Definitely a fun time with a great staff. Highly recommend.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>My group of friends and I (group of 4)came into town and played each of the rooms offered at Enchambered: Sacramento. Containment Breach was a great starter room that had a variety of puzzles, but was reasonably solvable. I would recommend this room first at this location to warm up for the other rooms. Whispering Halls was my personal favorite. Visually, this room is outstanding. There are so many different puzzles to keep you busy and each person engaged. So much fun interacting with the environment and working your way through the story. I would rank this room fairly difficult for a smaller group because there is a lot to do, but it is doable if you are experienced in puzzle rooms. The final room, skull witch, was by far the most difficult of the three rooms available at Enchambered. This room is packed with a lot of challenging and creative puzzles. This room looks amazing inside and out and keeps you on your toes with amazing effects. I don’t recommend this room unless you are experienced with puzzle rooms and are capable asking for help if you need to progress through the room. This room is lots of fun, it’s just more fun if you are better prepared for the challenge. Overall I recommend every single room at this location. We had an amazing time, made even better by the comedic and immersive staff. Their passion for puzzle rooms is clear and makes the experience even better. Shout out to David for being our game master for the evening ! Thanks guys for an awesome experience, can’t wait for future rooms!< /Review>< Pics>

It was really fun. I thought maybe since we had other people in our group it wouldn't be fun but working with others is totally ok. It's not weird or not not-fun at all. I had a blast even tho it was confusing to us to find certain clues. Will definitely try it out again but hopefully to get out the next time. It was a good learning experience and I can't wait for other mystery this place is going to add on.< /Review>

This place was great.  The staff were very attentive and helpful.  The facility was clean and ready to go when we got there.  Even the reservations were easy to make.  I was impressed start to finish.

The adventure itself was very well put together, very fun.  The puzzles had a range of complexity so that the adults and kids were both engaged without feeling. Bored or helpless.  The adventure covered three rooms and each had its puzzles with some extending to multiple rooms.  It was very clever.  We did not finish but there were only four of us, not 8.  We are definitely going back.</text>

We had such a fun time trying to "escape" from the science lab at Enchambered!! The puzzles were challenging, but certainly not impossible. Staff was wonderful, enthusiastic, helpful and encouraging. I would highly recommend grabbing a group of friends and trying this out. We went with friends to celebrate a birthday and had a blast. I already want to try another one of their rooms!< /text>

We did Whispered Halls.  It was an incredible experience.  I've done around 10-12 escape rooms and this one was the most enjoyable.  We escaped with 9 seconds left with only one real clue and only 5 people of the allowed 10.  Multiple rooms, cool tech, nice effects, great staff.  Overall a fantastic experience.  Will be back to try the other two rooms.</Review>

<Text>Presentation, ambience, audio quality and the high level aesthetic were all 5/5. Strong appreciation for the work that went into creating the Whispering Halls room. Based on those factors I would come back soon.

One piece of constructive feedback: Please make it more convenient to schedule private groups. I was concerned about sharing a room with another random group and my concerns were validated. Many in my group felt ignored and not included by these random strangers. This severely put a damper on their experience overall. I would not want to return if I was going to share another room with strangers. I can imagine how fun it would be with all close people sharing your very own experience.

I understand it is tough to pull in a certain amount of money per hour that the rooms are being used. I am also sure some groups would collaborate just fine. But I imagine this is not the case all the time. Thank you for all your work and dedication to bring such an activity to Sacramento.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Took my daughter and her 7 friends to experience the Whispering Halls room. What an amazing experience! They had so much fun. The decor in the room is amazing and you really have to concentrate to find the clues. They do offer help if you need it...which we did many times! Even with the help we still didn’t make it out, it’s a very difficult room. We will definitely be back, thinking about an adult only experience next time!!!< /Review>

<Review>I had such an amazing time that I just had to come in the following week to do another escape room that was equally as good as the first. Although there was a mechanism that malfunctioned the second time, the owners were so concerned about us having the full experience that we paid for that they the made the necessary arrangement in order for that to occur. You can definitely feel that the owners primary concern is making sure that their customers have an amazing time and that they are in the escale room business not for the money, but for providing an exhilarating experience for their customers.< /Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Resp>None< /Resp><user_name>Luke S.</user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>This was my first escape room. Well, I guess that’s not entirely true. I got locked in a bathroom when I was younger (like not within the past 2 years) and couldn’t figure out how the lock worked. In my defense this bathroom didn’t have a bunch of hints on how to get out, like escape rooms provide. I had to figure it out all on my own. The only hint I was given was one lock that majority of people knew how to unlock. Unfortunately, I wasn’t part of the majority and there was no one else in the bathroom to help me. I totally get why parents go into public restrooms with their kids now. I was in need of a parent or anyone else who understood basic bathroom locks and how they become unlocked. I had to figure it out on my own. I used my problem solving abilities accompanied with my panicking abilities to finally get the bathroom door unlocked. I honestly couldn’t tell you how I did it, but I can tell you I escaped that bathroom and will never be going back in it again.

What I’m trying to say is this is the second escape room I have been in and the first escape room I knowingly went into. I ended up being terrible at it, but I learned a lot. I learned to not show up drunk. I learned to not get too distracted with the items that make noises, even if they’re really cool noises. I learned to let someone else read the clues out loud because I suck at reading, especially when drunk. I also learned to not try random numbers for the locks, even if I feel like I’m a great guesser. Finally, I learned to not yell, “we escaped” after the employee opens up the door because time ran out. If I ever feel like I want to be trapped again, I’ll know what not to do for my next escape room.<//Text>< gmapID>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I tried my first escape room, Enchambered, while in Sacramento on a short visit with my 2 kids. It was a great experience. Caitlyn was our host. And she did a great job of giving us clues without outright telling us what to do. She was very friendly and my son was quite smitten with her. Anyway, we were in the “Containment Breach” room with another woman and her kids and their friends. As it turned out everyone worked together often in smaller groups but switching around. We were able to get out with about 20 seconds to spare. It’s just like you feel in the movies as you look at the countdown clock when something bad is about to happen. The nerves come into play. This room, the effects, the sights, the sounds and the decor were all quite well done. I was impressed and will visit again when I’m back in Sacramento.</Text>< pictures>

What a great challenge! Always something to look for or a puzzle to do! If you aren't sure just look deeper! We followed the rules briefing before and fumbled our way through the challenges. Highly recommended for some team building and fun conversation afterwards. Staff have a great hold on their games and are helpful when needed. 5/5!<//Review>

<Text>I recently played the Whispering Halls and Skull Witch.  Both were excellent.  They clearly put a lot of effort into their decor and theatrical effects.  I would have liked to see the stories fleshed out a little bit more, as well as some more complex puzzles (disclosure: I write puzzles for another escape room); however, the immersive experience of these rooms more than makes up for that.<//Text>< pics>

The details are in the details. Each room is highly decorated and lighting is to intensify the mood. The escape room itself was very well made and fairly difficult but achievable. The level of light in the escape room was (and this is purely my opinion) a little dark and almost too dim to see all the puzzles, but I do put the caviat that I dont have the best of vision. The whole experience was very enjoyable and I would recommend trying if you enjoy puzzle solving and working as a team to achieve a goal.< /Review>

<text>My friend group has now experienced all the rooms that they have to offer and they're all amazing! We've been to a couple other escape rooms, and we feel like Enchambered definitely has some of the most immersive rooms. Their puzzles are pretty unique and the mechanics they are used are really interesting. Their staff are also very helpful and enthusiastic about their rooms. I would definitely recommend this place for family groups or friends</text>< gmap_id>

Drew was helpful during our game and afterwards discussed the puzzles and clues with us being funny and kind. We had a great experience doing the Skull Witch room, and got to take pictures after. I highly recommend these escape rooms because they're very detailed and fun for all types of people even tough guys like my boyfriend. Go into it with an open mind and immerse yourself in the environment and have a blast. Bring your friends!<//Text>

Enchambered is quite an incredible experience. I've been three times now and can't get enough. They pay great attention to detail. I would come just because they do such a great job with the atmosphere, but the element that puts it over the top is the puzzles. They are so well thought-out and creative. Whatever team comes up with the interconnected puzzles for this location are extremely talented - genius. It is exhilarating
, fun, and worth every penny. I highly recommend trying it with a group of friends or family. We did an 8-person room and our game master was Colbey.<//review>

We had a group of 6 in the skull witch puzzle room. From the time you enter the building you are transported. There's lockers to keep your stuff safe. The skull witch room is decorated amazingly and the puzzles make you think.  We did end up using some hints and it did take the full hour to finish it.  You  get totally immersed in the game and I'm so happy the orginal place we were going to try didn't work out. Can't wait to try another room soon.</review>

I HIGHLY recommend this place. It's super fun especially when you come with your friends. It was my first escape room, and it almost felt like a super intense scavenger hunt. I love how new clues can unlock to new rooms that can unlock new clues from the previous rooms. It's super cool and the staff there are also really nice. They're really patient with you even when you arrive a bit late to the time which is something other escape rooms are super strict about.< /Text>

My wife and I have gotten to run all three rooms available (as of writing this) and we've loved all of them. Between the atmosphere of the room, the quality of the puzzles, and the enthusiasm of the employees, Enchambered is absolutely a top-tier Escape Room. The last one we tried out was the Skull Witch room. We had a late game on a weekday, so we ended up being the only two people out of a room designed for six. We didn't think that we fared too well, but when our hour was up our Games Master Nicky(I hope I spelled that correctly!) Was extremely encouraging and really just a joy to be able to talk to. High quality all around, I cannot recommend this place enough!<//text>

Amazing facility and I love how they decorated the facility and designed the rooms. I really felt I was in another place. We had 6 people in our room for Whispering Halls. I loved that the puzzles didn’t have to be solved in order so that we could spread out. I also loved that they had hidden rooms. This place was recommended by the owners of NorCal Escape Rooms and I can definitely see why.< /text>

Our group had a great time! We went for my wife's birthday and booked the whole room (Whispering Halls).  If you've never been I would suggest getting a group together so you can experience it with people you know.  IMO it makes it easier to work together.  Great puzzles and attention to detail.  Would highly recommend Enchambered.<//Text>

This/these is/are the best escape room(s) I have ever been to. I have done two of the three current rooms and they're a load of fun, large and expansive, and very creative.  The special effects and props are amazing and the staff has been friendly and helpful with each visit.  They are family run and operated and even suggested other high quality rooms in the central valley.  You can't go wrong here.  This is coming from someone who thought the escape room experience would be lame until I did it.  I will say this place may be a hair more difficult than many other places with a fairly low escape rate.< /Text>

<Text>The amount of detail that went into creating these rooms is unbelievable! The decor, the puzzles, and the staff are all exceptional. I have tried every room multiple times and have brought back family and friends. They were even really accommodating with providing better/extra lighting for my parents whose eyesight isn't the best.

{'time': 1550677525341, 'text': "We're disappointed to hear you were unhappy with the other members in your group, Craig, and that the room was more difficult for you than you thought it would be. We clearly state that you will be combined with another party if you have less than the desired number of players for a particular room. The rooms are designed to be challenging and are often very difficult for a single player or couples, which is why we combine parties. It just so happened that you came in on the day of an 18th birthday celebration and that your reservation fit with theirs. We're sorry if their party wasn't your first choice, but we hope you'll consider giving a rooms another chance so you can get the full experience you were hoping for. We do, however, recommend coming in with the max number of players on a weekend if you don't want to join in with another party again. We do PRIVATE games during the week for players that wish to try the games with just friends and family. Just give us a call to schedule a private game, we will do our best to schedule a game for your group. -Joe, Owner"}</resp>

<Text>Took my girlfriend here who had never been to one of these.  Thought we were going to join up with the mellow group in the lobby but no, they had us join up with a group of extremely loud obnoxious teenage girls.  Apparently for an 18th birthday party.  Pretty sure the max is supposed to be 10 but there were 11 of us crammed into a tiny room.  The first clues were way too hard and it was extremely dark.  They gave one person a lantern but come on...11 people aren’t going to be able to share the light.  We eventually figured out how to unlock a secret bookshelf passageway that opened up into a larger room which increased the space...thank god.  The only reason I’m giving this a 2 vs a 1 is that the effects were really good.  The problem was every time the lights went out, I had 9 teenage girls shrieking..pretty sure I lost some hearing from this.  Anyway, they had a phone and would call us with clues but the one that you really had to solve first was way too hard and the clue they gave me wasn’t anything I hadn’t already figured out.  Really wish they would cap the group size at 7 or 8 and that they would have made it a little lighter..hour of my life I’ll never get back 😒< /Text></record>

We did the Skull Witch room (finally) after doing the other two rooms here first. My friends and I had a BLAST! Danny was our game master, she was soooo great - letting us talk all about the puzzles and room right after with her, and taking lots of pictures for us. It was challenging and the puzzles were brilliantly tied in with the theme. The room we were in was full-out decorated, and the lights and effects made the whole experience fantastic! DEFINITELY recommend to go here for an escape room experience!<//Review>

<text>Going to this escape room was probably the best decision I could have made for my birthday. We went into the Skull Witch room and, though we didn't escape,   we were thrilled to have made it 80% through. With this being our first ever escape room experience, we decided to go back and would up completing the Whispering Halls room in the nick of time. We will definitely recommend this to our friends and will return to best the witch at her game soon!</text>< date>

I took my family here to celebrate my mom's birthday and we had an amazing time! The staff was helpful and friendly, and the actual game itself (we tried the "Containment Breach" room) was a blast! If you're looking for something new and fun to do with family and friends, I would definitely recommend giving Enchambered a go! You won't regret it!< /text>

Super fun and challenging. This was my second time here. I did the skull witch room this time and we didn't escape but it was spooky and exciting. We did a pretty good job (solved 75% of the puzzles) considering we only had half the amount of people in the room. The room was made for 6 people but we only had 3. I highly recommend this place.<//Text>

We did Whispering Halls for my friends birthday and had a wonderful time! We had about 9 people in the room which ended up being perfect. The puzzles were reasonable and we were so close to getting out, but were stuck on the last one.
Compared to other Escape rooms, I love how the hint system is set up here.< /review>

<text>I booked the contamination Breach as a work team building event.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy the experience from the moment we entered the lobby until the debriefing we had in the parking lot.  The environment has a lot of character and is well decorated to get into mystery mode.  The hour long room escape was very challenging but we were able to complete a fair amount of the tasks, which was very satisfying.  We did not complete the entire thing in the hour but for our first try we did pretty well, had a great time and were engaged the entire time.  The staff was friendly, helpful and created a positive atmosphere.  I will definitely go back and look forward to trying other rooms.  I hope you add more themes!</text><Gmap_id>0x809ada3a26708365:0x8bb19e45ee56c972< /Gmap_id><user_id>101852416014237834518</user_id>< date>

Awesome experience!!! Booked 2 sessions back to back for a birthday party. Staff was extremely courteous, friendly and very professional. The owner and team went out their way to accommodate us allowing the party to be a success. We were allowed to bring outside food, party room had a TV for movies and games were available.  All 14 Kids had a blast in the escape room and was the talk of the party. The interor is decorated to meet the theme and excitement sets in as soon you walk in the door. Highly recommend!!!!!<//Review>

Our group of ten had THE BEST TIME today at Enchambered. We were a mix of first-time escape artists and intermediate-level artists, and all of us had a blast. The room was full of plenty of puzzles to work on in different teams, and crazy amounts of crawl spaces, secret rooms, and scary ambience. So amazing.
The staff was wonderful. Nice, helpful, and entertaining.</review>

Amazing presentation. This is a really top notch room. The craftsmanship was far above anything I’ve seen.Definitely the best escape room I’ve done so far.  I think they could Hone some of the puzzles so that the process that it takes to complete the puzzles works better… Don’t want to give any spoilers, but there was one puzzle that we were doing in the correctly, but it didn’t work until we did it several times. Of course it’s supposed to be hard, it’s a difficult room. I would also have liked to have a clock, or an easier way to see the time count down. I still don’t exactly know how that worked. Also some of the clues were spoken, but a little hard to hear. Another thing they could improve is to Make sure that the clues are being given in a timely fashion, it seems like perhaps the game master was not able to keep up with our progress, and we were getting some old clues to things we had already solved.< /review>

We did the Containment Room. The staff was great. Friendly, helpful, and they had us organized and moving into our room on time. Very well run. This was our first time and we didn't know what to expect. We had a blast. The puzzles were fun and not unrealistic or impossible to solve or too easy. And the staff is available for hints if needed. They really want you to have a good experience. Afterwards I polled our group and every single person had a great time and said they would do it again.<//Text>

<review>Fun experience with just the right amount of intrigue and spookiness. We were a group of nine that did The Whispering Halls room. The clues were great and very well put together. There were several moments when we gasped because a puzzle led to something we didn’t expect. We definitely all want to try it again.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>This is a one room escape house, very clever very complex. It was built by a family with a dream and the ability to make it happen. They did a great job and they're not afraid to help you out and they're right there to do it. I love this place I can't wait to see the Next Room. Talk about the American dream be very proud of you and your family.</Review>< pics>

<Text>This was our second room at enchambered. This time Nicky was our game master. This time we encountered the Skull Witch. The puzzles were difficult and thematic with a variety to the rooms.

Starting from entering the building this escape room is full of ambiance. I highly recommend it for an escape room experience if you're looking for one. Check the difficulty of  your room before choosing, they're pretty on point for how hard they are from what I've seen.</Text></record>

It was a lot of fun.  Played with 7 other friends and escaped the room.  The presentation was amazing.  Lights, sounds, clues, puzzles, hidden rooms all enhanced the experience and made the scenario more exciting.  The hour went by quickly.   The whole experience never felt dull or lagging.  We are definitely going back again.<//Text>

So First of all this place was absolutely amazing!!! I was hoping it would be good and it absolutely blew my mind! I’ve been three times and have done the Whispering Halls once and the Skull Witch twice and they both are spectacular! I got to say I think the Skull Witch is my favorite though just because of the overall theme of the room. The service there is amazing. Our games masters all three times have been awesome and made my experience great. They know exactly when to drop a little hint to keep you moving and might give you a few jump scares out of nowhere which I love! I totally recommend anyone coming here and I promise you will have a ton of fun! Thank you Enchambered for giving me such and amazing and fun time! Special shoutout to my favorite games master Amy! She’s just sooo awesome and gives some really good jump scares out of nowhere! Thank you so much Amy!< /Text>

This was my first time doing an escape room.  I was in a group of three, and there was another group of five that joined us.  We did the Whispering Halls room.  We made it out - but with no time to spare!  The whole experience was great.  The employees were all very friendly.  You definitely need a big group for this room - the max is 10 and we had eight.  It took every one of us working on clues and puzzles, and communicating - to the very end - to make it out!  It was kind of stressful - knowing we only had an hour to solve everything - but it was a lot of fun.  I will definitely be trying the other two rooms here for sure!  Thanks!<//Review>

My first escape room experience and I believe Enchambered has set the bar high! Went into Whispering Halls with 2 friends + 6 strangers and we all had a great time solving the creatively conceived puzzles. It was a lot more interactive than I expected and some of the effects had me wondering how they were rigged up 🤔 Would recommend 👍<//Text>

We had a great time at Enchambered for my birthday. I would highly recommend it! They maintained excellent communication while waiting for my friends to purchase their "reserved" tickets. They were also able put a chair in our room for me in case i needed to sit. Me and my friends were pleasantly surprised by how excellent the decor was; they obviously put a lot of effort into the overall atmosphere.
We can't wait to go back!<//review>

Enchambered: Sacramento Escape Room was above and beyond the experience I thought an escape room was. The puzzles were hard, but fun. The special effects/theatrics really set it apart. Real love, thought and creativity went into these rooms. It was like being at kind of a creepy Disneyland!< /Review>

Wow! Enchambered Escape Rooms is definitely next level. My husband, myself and our two friends came to do Skull Witch and we had a blast. We've all done escape rooms before 10+ between the two couples and Enchambered is the best and most immersive we've been too. The rooms are synced so intrinsically to the themes you literally feel like you are in the story. The way everything in the rooms would adjust with each puzzle was so exciting. We loved the clue system and the timers that were built into the room! So much more enjoyable than other traditional systems. We didn't get out, but our host said we were about 85% complete. We can't wait to come back and try it again because we want to know how the story ends! We also want to attempt the other two rooms as well! Thank you for a fantastic date night Enchambered! We will be back soon!

UPDATE:

We just came back and completed Whispering Halls. Wow! There is not a better put together escape room in the area. It was so well done, the whole ambiance was beautifully decorated, creepy and the staff is just beyond awesome. So excited to come back in the future!<//text>

< review>
My group did the containment breach scenario. The puzzles and ciphers were clever and the level of challenges appropriate for a one hour adventure. A lot of thought went into it and the props all worked as they were supposed to. I would have liked to have seen a little more of the mythology for our adventure, the creators clearly had a compelling story line, but it devolved into a series of solving puzzles for their own sake.</review>

From the minute we walked thru the door all the staff were hospitable and polite. Entering the game we were given perfect instructions on what to do and what not to do. Very helpful. The backstory on the room helped with the game and our game master , Koya, was great. With his help and the clues in the room we finished with 9 minutes to spare. It was such an amazing experience. I envy all of you for being able to work in that environment everyday but I will absolutely be back again.<//text>

Our team of 10 employees thoroughly enjoyed Enchambered.  It was very nice to see all the team members work together on the clues.  Even though we did not make it all the way, we had fun!  That's what it is all about "FUN".  We will be scheduling this event for our quarterly outings.</Text>

We chose the Containment room. It was a great challenge, entertaining, and truly fun for the whole group.  Requires good problem solving, communication, and teamwork. An amazing experience.  Hats off to our room host, Zeph. There were a couple times we were a tad off track or needed a tiny nudge to keep going with a clue.  Zeph assisted to perfection, enhancing our escape room adventure. All of the hosts were gracious and made for a very positive experience. Loved the atmosphere and props (obviously took great effort and thought) that added to the totally well done Enchambered experience. All 7 of us are ready to do it again!< /Review>< Pictures>

I would highly recommend it to my friends and family.

my group didn’t manage to finish the room, but it was an absolutely fantastic time regardless. originally, they didn’t have an available time that fit our schedule, but after calling they quickly transferred me to the manager who was beyond helpful. she immediately asked what time worked best for us and searched for employees to help fill that time slot. within a half hour she opened up a new spot for us to reserve online. the puzzles for the ‘skull witch’ room were phenomenaly difficult while also being extremely accesible and fun. i would 100% recommend this place for ANY occasion.</Text>

The puzzles are hard but not impossible (we didn't finish one room and escaped the second with 58 seconds to go) and the clues (should you choose to use them) are helpful without giving away an answer.

<Text>Came here with my brother and 12 year old sister.  We got paired up with a few other guys. We all instantly clicked and had the time of our lives inside this place. As soon as you walk in the doors your instantly caught by the decor and hard work these people have put into this place. The room was amazing, probably the best escape room I have been able to be inside. We solved the room with 2 mins left and it was just great. They put so much hard work into this room and you can tell. Very detailed. I will definitely be back when they open up the new rooms.! Worth every penny<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>I've done a few escape rooms around the Sacramento area before, but I've got to say that Whispering Halls at Enchambered absolutely blew the rest out of the water. I've never seen so much production value and cleverness put into an escape room before. The only possible parallel I could compare the level of ambience and polish the whole place has would be to the waiting areas of the Haunted Mansion and the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Disneyland.
I really cannot recommend this place enough for escape room enthusiasts and i wish i could give a few examples of what made my group's experience so awesome, but I don't want to spoil the surprises!

We're DEFINITELY coming back to try one of the other rooms!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

This was an awesome escape room experience. My friends and I did Whispering Halls and it was probably the most elaborate and detailed escape room I've completed so far. The only downside to this room is that if you don't get to know everyone you're playing with, there's bound to be chaos. This is a 12 person room, so communication is key. I think if this room held a max of 10, it would be great, but ideally, you could probably get the job done with 8 or 9. Still, I'm excited to come back and try the next puzzle 😀</text>

Went as a work group and had a great time. We were a group of 7 and did Whispering Halls. None of us had ever done anything like that before and didn't know what to expect. The decor was very well done, the room challenging, and the whole thing was very well organized. It was fun, and we all definitely look forward to going again.<//Text>

It was really fun! We plan to go again and try a different room. We were 4 people in an 8-person room, and I think if we had 8 people it would have been too crowded, but easier to do puzzles. Having just 4 people was cramped in some places. We had so much fun though and can't wait to go again!< /text>

My senior project group and I went here for our team bonding exercise. The location was a bit awkward, as it is visibly blocked from the street by the restaurant out front. That being said, once you get inside it is a very nice escape room. You can tell that the owners put a lot of effort into giving the place a "creepy" feeling and give you a challenging task to solve. There is ambient and creepy music playing in the background, but it isn't too off putting and I could see doing this again with my family or my girlfriend. Definitely planning on coming back again to try some of the other rooms.</Review>

<Time>1502671144952<//Time><Text>We (me and my two teen boys) traveled five hours to go there.  Would not have went without it having been rated so high.  Its located by some shopping and eating places.  The workers were young and nice.  I wish I would have had at least one other person near my age, 41, as all were no older than 21.  I can't think as fast as them so I was kinda left in dust :) My team played the hardest one, whispering, and won with 8 players and two hints.  If I were to do again I would bring a friend my age or my sister.  The boys enjoyed it but said they wished they were more envolved as a team.  I think they just need to emphasize to work more as a team, w everyone.  The set up is good and I would do this again if I lived closer, 5 hours isn't worth it.  All in all, it wasn't bad, just the few issues I had made it throw me off from giving a perfect rating.<//Text>< rate>

This was our second escape room experience and it was SO MUCH FUN! The theatrical elements were planned and executed extremely well, from the physical details of the room to the soundtrack playing in the background. We did the room at the intermediate level of difficulty, and it was really hard -- in my opinion harder than the highest level of difficulty at the other escape room we did. The whole experience, from the lobby to the staff to the room itself, was awesome. One of the mechanisms didn't work quite right, requiring the assistance of our game supervisor, and possibly costing us the opportunity to successfully complete the room, which was a little disappointing, but still so much fun. We would love to go back again for another room!<//review>

They are different levels of expertise, but we're happy that didn't take away from the excitement! If you're interested in a more difficult room, then we definitely recommend trying the Skull Witch room -- we think you'll really enjoy it. We also have another room we're working on and hope to open it soon. Looking forward to your next escape! -Joe, Owner"}<//Resp>< Name>

<Text>Tonight was my second escape room ever at Enchambered. The staff is phenomenal and very informative both times we’ve gone. The first one we did was Whispering Halls and it was AMAZING! I don’t think I’ve ever had so much fun and loved all the sound effects/ puzzles and surprises around every turn. So fun and suspenseful and you could tell a lottttt of thought went into it (medium level).

Tonight we did Containment Breach (easy level) and although it was still fun I would have loved to see it more like Whispering Halls. Probably just because of the level it was I’m guessing?

Still need to try the hardest one (Skull something) next time!(:</Text><gmapID>0x809ada3a26708365:0x8bb19e45ee56c972<//gmapID><Rate>5<//Rate>< user>

Great themes, awesome immersion into the theme with the rooms, a great variety of types of puzzles and mechanics. Only recommendation is reduce the maximum capacity of the larger rooms by 2 people. Gets but crowded and some participants get left out. Love it otherwise and looking forward to the next adventure!<//Text>

<text>I've done several escape rooms across the country and this place put them all to shame. The decorations and atmosphere of the rooms are so flip-dang top level, and the puzzles are very cool and rewarding. I've done two rooms here so far and both were a hoot and a half - maybe even two hoots! Hannah was very friendly, and was a great game master. We probably wouldn't have completed Skull Witch on time without her. The hints she gave were right on queue but didn't make the room too easy. I'm now reluctant to visit any other escape room because they will more than likely pale in comparison to Enchambered, but at the same time I don't give a care because I got to experience the best. Would recommend to a friend or stranger.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1551457660541, 'text': "This is amazing, Andy -- thank you!

Everything was done with very high quality props and they staged it so well. The only thing I didn't like was a person in the group that me and my husband shared the room with, she was really obnoxious she's the kind of person that wanted to be the leader but was just bossy and annoying but that was not in the control of the business.  Next time we are going to get a room with all people we know.  I don't think it's an experience I would do with strangers again unless more people didn't knew each Other so it's not just me and my hubby vs 7 people that are all good friends. Just feels awkward.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Date>1540869256805< /Date><rating>5< /rating><review>I have done many escape games with several companies, but Enchambered is by far the BEST escape experience ever.  The production value of their sets is Hollywood caliber, and the intricacy of their puzzles and methods of delivery are top notch. I know that seems kind of vague, but there's really not much more I can say than that without spoiling things.  Just trust me; if you like or are even curious about escape the room games, Enchambered is a cut above the rest.< /review>< pics>

We escaped from the Skull Witch room. The theming was very good from the ones we have experienced. Puzzles were good to us and fair. We will definitely go back to do other rooms. We just need to find a few more players to do some of the larger rooms.</Review>

We participated in the Containment Breach escape here at Enchambered Sacramento and Dani was an excellent Game master letting us go on our own adventure and offering a guiding hand when we needed it the most. I've done well over 30 escape rooms in the area and Enchambered always raises my expectations of what an escape room should achieve. Dani let us know that there are 2 new escape rooms currently in progress and we will wait patiently until Enchambered can dazzle us once again with their tech, storytelling and amazing quality.
Best, Chris H</Review>

<review>This place was So Fun.  My group of four (paired with a group of three for seven total players) Loved our experience and would highly recommend Enchambered to others.  We'd been to other escape rooms (in Sac and other cities as well) and this one was the best!!  The production value was excellent - the quality of the rooms, the scenes, the props, and the puzzles and clues was so great.  Not only were the puzzles challenging, but they were integrated into the scene and props, and interesting to see, touch, manipulate, or examine.  There were so many puzzles and clues, and our scenario (Whispering Halls) was so convincing it actually freaked me out once in a while (but I'm a little chicken in creepy environments).  I liked that the puzzles came in so many forms and in unsuspecting forms.  This place is great, totally check it out if you want to try a lock room!< /review><Rate>5< /Rate>< gmapID>

We had 9 people and it was a little chaotic, hard to keep up on some clues. Some clues also were a little random and hard to put together. They are still working out a few kinks. We have done about 10 rooms total and this room ranks up in the top 3 for sure.</review></record>

This was so much fun and the room was complex enough that I was only in on the solutions to about half of the puzzles. I ended up going back with a different set of friends just so I could solve the other half. This was the second escape room I had ever been to and it completely blew the first one I went to out of the water.< /Text>

<time>1511741087602</time><rate>1< /rate><text>I booked this for a friends birthday party. When I called I spoke with a woman over the phone and I told her we weren't sure how many people were going to show up. She had told me that it was okay to book the entire room and that we could get some sort of discount on the tickets for people that didn't show. Only four people did the room and when I asked about getting any kind of discount for purchasing ten tickets (as recommended over the phone) I was told that that's not something they do. The woman kept explaining to me in a condescending way how tickets work and how they OBVIOUSLY wouldn't do that because they OBVIOUSLY couldn't sell tickets in a booked room. I kept telling her I understand that and that is what I would have that but not what I was told over the phone. Of course, they denied ever telling me anything like that and I probably had called the wrong escape room over the phone. Just a heads up to anyone else who is told this over the phone to make sure you get it in writing in an email or something to back it up.
Fun escape room but not worth the hundreds of dollars I felt conned into spending.</text>< Gmap_id>

UPDATE: Today we did the Whispering Halls and Enchambered once again knocked it out of the park! I do have a gripe about our game master entering the room and giving excessive unsolicited hints, but overall the experience was positive and I highly recommend booking a game here!< /review>< rating>

This was my 2nd time going to Enchambered, the rooms are so immersive and the puzzles are great!! The game masters really do want you to succeed and have fun. If I could give 4 1/2  stars, I would instead of the full 5. My reasoning didn't seem bad enough to knock it down a whole star. The reason for this is because this time around, we had a group of 4 and another group of 5 together in our room, a total of 9 (on the website it said the room can have a max of 10) people. Which is fine I don't mind doing the escape rooms with other people. But the Whispering Halls rooms, seemed small to be accommodating 9 people. There were moments where others were just in the way, or it was hard to move around. There were also moments where everyone was talking aloud to the point it was difficult to hear your own thoughts. If your going to do whispering halls, maybe going with a large group of your own people, so your more comfortable being close to each other. My only recommendation is for Enchambered to limit this room down to 8 max.

But the overall game play and how immersive the room is amazing! We also did our very first escape at Enchambered over a year ago. We will, of course, be back 😁 thanks enchambered for a great experience!</text>

<review>I can't believe we were 90% done with the witch one. First time trying it and had ton of fun solving the puzzles. Although, I believe there should be a timer inside the room, so people know how much time they have left. It really gives away the immersion when people are almost done and then boom your time is done. Which I didn't know we had a time, but still a lot of fun. p.s. the dead person in the basement had a nice ass.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Had a wonderful time at Enchambered! By far one of the best escape rooms I've done in the area, they do a wonderful job of creating a believable and fully immersed experience. The room is great for groups and allows different people to work on different puzzles simultaneously.  Would absolutely recommend and plan to go back when they open up their new room!<//Review>

<Text>You may be let down by the initial walk-in and start, but once you get into the puzzles and open up more, you'll be greatly impressed. Not meant for kids because the rooms are dark with occasional sound/light jumpscares. Some puzzles are hard, but still solvable...and there are a lot of puzzles. Highly recommend.

Update 5/2019: After going to other places in town, Enchambered is still highly recommended. The atmosphere and extra thought and care puts this place above the competition. I've heard people saying they didn't like it, but these were inexperienced people. You have to go with like-minded people and in a larger group to get the best experience.< /Text>< GmapID>

<review>I surprised my husband with the Enchambered experience for Father's Day. Our sons & daughter & her husband got to join him in the fun! Since our daughter has two little ones, I was going to take them (in the high heat) somewhere for an hour. --
BUT- the staff/owner was SO KIND, she offered & allowed us to stay in their B-day party room (since it wasn't being used) as we waited for our family to complete the room in :55min & 10 secs!! -- My husband & (adult) kids- enjoyed it so much!! They talked & talked about it for hours after!!
I would highly recommend this place for a family/ group-- & I have high praise for the kindness of the great staff/owner!!! THANK U!!<//review>< pictures>

We played Containment Breach, a game for up to eight people. In our case, the participants were our family of four and another family of four, all of whom were first timers to the escape room experience, although I have designed "breakouts" for my students, which are a similar concept, but require students to solve a series of puzzles to break into a box with multiple locks, using clues they must both find and decipher (and in my case, they are all in French). In any case, Containment Breach  was a very well-designed game, with interesting clues and surprises. The only thing that was unclear(and could perhaps be improved) in the context of the game was why we had to solve everything in an hour. Their upcoming game, Skull Witch, does a better job with the initial story arc that participants see before playing, making it clear why participants need to solve the mystery in an hour. This is a great way to spend part of an afternoon and we will definitely be back!</text>

<Review>The set design, sound design, and effects in Containment Breach were really impressive. All the puzzles worked smoothly, and there were fun surprises.

The staff is super enthusiastic about their business, and I enjoyed talking with Joe about their future plans.< /Review>< Pics>

Several escape rooms have popped up in the greater Sacramento area, but Enchambered offers the far superior experience. Their rooms are dripping with theme while including wonderful bits of technology. Looking forward to their next room!< /Review>

Some of the best escape rooms that I've been to. My group has been to over 30 escape rooms and would list all of Enchambered in the top 10. The Whispering Halls in particular was my favorite. Great theme, felt VERY immersive and creepy. The puzzles were awesome and everyone had a great time.< /review>

<Text>Enchambered is a really fun experience. The puzzles are very fun and challenging. All of the art work and props are very high quality. I am going to go through every room that opens. I highly recommend this place. If you have never been to an escape room TRY IT! You will leave Enchambered talking about it all day and wanting to go again.< /Text>< Response>

<text>Super immersive experience, they dont lock the doors so u can go pee anytime. They have lockers so that u can put your stuff and lock it up. Again very immersive and lots of puzzles to solve to get out. Would suggest the victorian haunting dollhouse one for big groups. There are several rooms of puzzles to go through< /text>< Pictures>

We've done both the Containment Breach and the Whispering Halls rooms. The decor is amazing! The puzzles are challenging (which is awesome), and the rooms are loaded with crawl spaces & secret passages to other rooms. My one and only suggestion to Enchambered is to try having the game masters get into character a bit, perhaps memorize the sheet they read off when beginning the room? It would make it more fun for the guests. But having said that, don't misunderstand me, Enchambered has the BEST escape rooms, an incredible facility, and great staff!! Definitely go!!</review>

I had a work event here on Thursday 12/1/16 and I had a great experience. This was the first escape room  I have done and I was really impressed with the room, the puzzles and the staff. If you have any interest in trying an escape room, i highly recommend the "Containment Breach" room at Enchambered. For those interested, the parking is good, the staff is helpful and friendly and the facility is nice and clean. The room and puzzles were very well crafted and challenging. If you are curious about escape rooms, I recommend Enchambered. I will be back for the new rooms when they are completed!<//review>

<review>Was our first time so we were really confused on where to begin.   We didnt escape but the kids had alot of fun.   We needed to solve 2.5 more puzzles but ran out of time.    The only thing i didnt like was that its just too short of time to have fun.   Concerts and movies they are all atleast usually 1.5 to 2 hours.   Wish it was a little longer even tho it mite be maybe harder but just a little longer than an hour of fun would be nicer.   We tried the easiest level.   We will be back to try the other levels too.    Can u guys make the experience longer than an hour?    Anyways it was still fun.<//review>< Name>

First visit was great. Second visit was awful. Their refund policy is ridiculous. They have nothing in place in case of issues within groups even if the episode hasn't even started. The only thing offered was to come next day and they only gave us the option of one time slot. Will not be coming back.< /Review>

<Text>Highest production value around for an escape room. This is a great multipart room, but w/so much to do in it, the room should probably be rated 75/90 min instead of the standard 60. Fun, challenging room. Go refreshed and ready to think.</Text>< Resp>

<Text>I went with my son and his girlfriend. As soon as you walk in the door, the decorations set a spooky and exciting mood, kind of like Disney's haunted mansion. From the lobby, we heard (actual) people screaming while working on their escape! The guide told us that solving the puzzles to escape the room starts out slow and really picks up in the 2nd half hour. That's exactly the experience we had. We were racing toward the end, and it was exciting! We walked out of there plotting our next visit! It was super fun!< /Text>< Date>

<Review>This was my first escape room experience and I had a blast. The owner/operators were kind and explained the Rules cleary prior to starting. I was completely blown away by the atmosphere and quality of the room, props and sets. The design and theme of the room really pulls you deep into the game. My wife an I went with 4 of our friends who have been to other escape rooms. Those 4 veterans all agreed enchambered was there favorite escape room experience to date.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>OMG this was the best time ever!!! We went for a work offsite and team builder, and from the start the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. They prepared coffee and tea for us while ill group gathered. They continues to check on us and ensured we had everything we needed. The game was super fun and only if we had 5 more minutes we actually would have escaped! The conference room we rented was set up very nice and was plenty of room for our group. Our food was catered in and we had a really great time! Again the staff continued to check on us and really took great care of us!! We will go back for sure!<//text>< pictures>

<user_id>108473479024016983896< /user_id><Text>Had a great time until we got near the end.  Then the technical difficulties started.  The sensors were not working properly so one of the final clues failed to work.  We spent our last 5 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong even though we processed the clue requirements correctly.  After the final buzzer, the Game Master had to fidget with it for a couple minutes to get it to work.  Very disappointing to spend over $200 on the game which didn't work properly and ended in failure, disappointment and regret.< /Text>< time>

Enchambered is simply the best escape room company in the Sacramento area. Their combination of technology, immersive rooms, fascinating puzzles, and interesting themes are second to none. I have had multiple "wow" moments in their rooms!< /text>

Visited  tonite with 7 others;  4 newbies  and 4 second timers . Upon entering , we were totally impressed with the 2 gentlemen hosts and the ambiance they have created.  After a short briefing, we entered Containment Breach and were on our way.  What an adventure we had! Although we did not "escape" the room, we all had a blast.  I will be telling our friends who want a new and exciting activity to definitely visit Enchambered Sacramento!!!< /review>

<Text>What a cool experience. We have not been to Enchambered twice this year and have had a blast each time. The level of detail and creativity is out of this world. It's almost like these folks were former imagineers for Disney. It's that good. This is perfect for groups or a few close friends. Do yourself a favor and head on over to Enchambered and be prepared to have more fun than you've had in a long time.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>This is my 14th escape room and it was hands down the best, most immersive escape room I've ever been in. Also the staff was more than willing to setup a custom time for just 4 of us so if you don't see a time slot then call them!!!<//Text>< resp>

As soon as you enter the facility, a gothic steam punk ambience does well in fostering an alternate reality feel... Baudrillard would be proud. The staff was welcoming, friendly, and helpful as my friend and I were first timers to escape rooms. The room was fun, scary, and appropriately challenging - we will certainly come back to try more rooms in the future - but I do have a few considerations for Enchambered to explore that if handled appropriately could improve costumers future experiences.

1.) As earlier noted, my friend and I were new to escape rooms and had the room to ourselves. However, about an hour before our game, two people signed up to join us in our time slot (which was totally fine). The issue that arose for my partner and I was that these two individuals who signed up last second had done the same exact room before. As you could imagine, that was a huge spoiler for us as they knew all of the puzzles already. We didn’t get to do much. I’m not sure how this problem can be fixed, or if it can, but maybe when people buy tickets there should be a question about whether they’ve done the room their signing up for before so if there is someone who has already reserved tickets for a room that they haven’t done before, their experience isn’t spoiled by someone who has - rather, the person who has done the room before must do a different time slot. Likewise, if there are two people who have done the room before that reserved tickets in a particular time slot, someone who hasn’t done the room before could see that the two people that have done the room before reserved tickets, and they could try a different timeslot with people who haven’t done the room before if they wish. I’m not exactly sure how to fix it, but that was a huge bummer for us.

2.) One other recommendation is to have merchandise for when costumers escape the room... like a shirt that says “I escaped” or even give them a cheap dollar store trophy for their success. I think it’s nice for people who escape to have something to take home to remind themselves of their experience... and also to remind them to come back again. We definitely would have bought something if we could have.

If it wasn’t for those things it would have been a five star experience. I give it a solid four and will come back again hopeful of an improved experience.</Text>

I went into being a bit skeptical ($35 per person) and had a wonderful and fun experience, well worth the cost (and the staff helps you out when you get as bit stuck). I look forward to exploring a different room next time.<//review>

Great experience!!!!!! We had 8 people working on the clues to get out of this room, which turned into three rooms of clues to get out.

<Review>Amazing, fun, and immersive experience! This was totally worth the 30-35 dollars per person. Our game master was helpful and enthusiastic, which made the whole experience that much more pleasant.
Enchambered’s Escape rooms, including their props and storylines, are truly well thought out and pretty impressive. We did the whispering halls with only two people (this room is supposed to have 10 players!) and even though we got nowhere close to escaping, it was so much fun for my boyfriends birthday!! We will be back with more people to see if we can make it through...</Review>< resp>

From the moment you enter the lobby you will be able to see how much detail and care were put into the creation of these escape rooms. The staff is professional and friendly, and clearly love what they do. While we were getting briefed, we could hear another group in one of the rooms and-- no joke-- it sounded like they were performing an exorcism in there. With that much screaming we knew it was going to be good.

While I won't spoil any gameplay, I can tell you that the ambience is out of this world, with audio/visual/lighting elements enriching the experience. The gameplay is well-suited for a larger group, as long as everyone works together. As a veteran escapee, I was delighted at the sheer number of original elements and puzzles. Hints, rather than directions, helped us solve the tricky game mechanics.

The Enchambered Team is developing a whooping 7 escape games, although only 2 are available to play at the time I'm writing this review. I will definitely be back to play the others!</text>

Enchambered is an unparalleled, high tech multi-sensory experience! I took my teenage kids and a couple of their friends to the "Containment Breach" room. It's challenging, exciting, fun, and a great tool for encouraging teamwork and hands-on learning.

The owners spared no expense by designing and installing realistic sound and lighting, and building professional grade props and mechanical devices. Their passion and meticulous attention to detail can be seen everywhere you look. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Enchambered, kudos to the owners and staff!</Review>

My friends and I went the other night for my seventeenth birthday. We chose the Containment Breach room, and it was AWESOME!! The safety training was brief, helpful, and the staff was friendly, warm, and very funny.  The place was immersive as soon as you went into the lobby - the decor and atmosphere made the experience feel real and puzzle pieces in the room perfectly matched the theme. Throughout the game, we used teamwork, screaming, and stupid jokes to propel ourself through challenging puzzles and crawl spaces to solve the mystery. The gamemaster was really sweet and always clear when we (or the gamemaster) called for hints. The gamemaster sometimes even came into the room if he saw we were going in a completely different direction or just having one or two problems with one particular puzzle. I was told they’re planning on opening two more rooms, and I can’t wait to invite my friends and head off to Enchambered again! I would give them ten stars, but Google only lets me put five.< /review>

-good puzzle balance,  not all locks or all math,  had different puzzles that allowed people of a specific skill set to excel.
-Great room design and construction, we've been to others that look run down and doesn't seem maintained,  keep it up.
-puzzle theme atmosphere. Every puzzle usually has a theme and about 10mins into it the theme is lost and the focus is puzzles.  This place keeps you engaged. You spend the entire time immersed into the theme and sound effects were on point.

My only con and this is very slight. Make a leaderboard,  allow for team names, time records, and amount of hints taken.  People like to brag a bit and help them do that. Our group had 15 mins to spare,  beat that!

To wrap it up this place is legit. Don't let my review inflate your assumptions about this place book a room and check them out.<//review></record>

This is an updated review for the new room Whispering Halls. If you haven't done Containment Breach I can't recommend it enough but Whispering Halls takes this place to a whole new level!

This is hands down the most well thought out, intricate room in the Sacramento area that I have done so far and I have done most. Let's start from the beginning.

My team of 8 arrived to Enchambered and immediately upon entering could tell the owners truly loved escape rooms. It was dimly lit and set the mood and transported you away from the outside world, they had very detailed painting of an elevator door on the door leading to the lockers and the rooms. After completing the standard paperwork and locking up our phones we entered a long hallway that had very nice mood music and creepy sounds which only enhanced the experience.

For this trip Joe invited us to live Beta the newest room at the site which is The Whispering Halls. Most of my team had already played Containment Breach and loved the game to the point that we thought it was the best in the Sacramento region but Whispering Halls blew it out of the water. The room was so elegantly decorated and never stopped surprising or impressing. I've done about 20 rooms all over California and I have never experienced a room like this! I am rather jaded when it comes to escape rooms as I can usually tell you where hidden doors are or whats going to happen when you solve a puzzle. This room not only kept me guessing but there were several times where myself and some longtime teammates stopped and said "this is absolutely amazing!" to each other.

I really don't want to spoil anything but the fact that you are "paranormal investigators" and you have been asked to find ghosts and get rid of them should hint to you what kind of surprises your in for. There were some legitimate moments of dread and the i was anxious the entire time I was inside and that's very difficult to do. The music and sound effects where amazing. You can literally hear some of the sound effects traveling behind the walls. The visual effects that you will encounter are really well done. Your in room timer is really unique and fits into the story line really well.

The puzzles were a bit more difficult this time through as compared to their other room but they make sense and there is not many logic leaps if any at all. If I were to give this room a difficulty rating I would say 4 out of 5. We ended up escaping with 18 minutes to spare, but if I am being honest I would have loved to escape with no time on the clock because I would want to spend my entire hour lost in the world they created in this space. It's truly amazing.

We had a chance to chat with the owner post game and he asked for our feedback on what could be done better and honestly, there wasn't much we could tell him on what to do different or things we found troublesome. Most of the time we gushed about how amazing it was. He shared with us the things he wants to change and add to the room and when he does it's going to be unbelievable.

Take my advice, as a HUGE fan of this industry Enchambered has it dialed in and the team there should be recognized and one of the most creative and technologically advanced teams not just in the area but the industry as a whole. For a local mom and pop shop to be this impactful is a testament to their passion for what this industry should really be about.

Go. Do. This. Room.<//review>

I brought my kids and their friends for the 1st time.  Even though we didn’t make it out in time, we still had a blast! It exceeded our expectations. Looking to go back and try the other rooms!</text>

my group and i have done all the rooms here, and every time the staff has been welcoming, friendly, and overall super helpful! The last one we did was skull witch, and our game room master was Hannah! she was so nice and even open to talking to us about the room and our experience with escape rooms. we’ll will be waiting for the new rooms!</review>

Phenomenal experience!  Our family went in for a birthday and having never done an escape room I wasn't sure what to expect.

Without spoilers I can honestly say it took everyone everything we had!

Andrew was an excellent host and even made the post game experience a fun and welcoming.  Will most assuredly be returning to enjoy the other rooms!< /review>

Incredible experience.  Skull Witch room was so intense.  Made it out with 30 seconds to go.  Andrew was extremely helpful and helped set the tone for the experience.  Recommend this to ANYONE willing to try something new, challenging, entertaining!<//Text>
