I live in the mountains and have had a really hard time finding reasonable home insurance. This team is amazing. They have gone up and beyond the call of duty to help and problem solve..not only getting me set up with a good plan, but when another company and agency's buisness practices caused a large snafu that left me in a huge lurch they were amazing helping me to get my money back. Love them.<//review>

Carly Pickern's Allstate Agency staff was sympathetic and quick in settling our claim. We picked the company we wanted to do our repairs, picked the date and time we wanted and had excellent timely service. As we are new clients to Carly I wasn't sure what kind of experience this was to be. I was pleasantly surprised at the rapid and very very courteous service we received. They went above and beyond for us and I am thankful.</text>

The people at the Allstate office in Redding are a nice group of people; they made me feel very comfortable being there for the first time. The agent who helped me was Angela she was very informative, and sweet helped us get the best price for both our auto and home owner insurance. When everything was completed I felt relieved and left the office with a stress free mind, body, and soul. Thank you Angela and Allstate for putting us into your good hands. -Leslie & Vickie L.</Text>

<Review>I've had a simple renter's policy with them for a few years and it was really easy to get, price seems good, and requires very little input on my part (a huge plus). I decided to get life insurance a few months ago so I had a couple long chats with an agent about what best matched my needs and picked a policy. There was a  health screening involved and the nurse came to my house at the day and time that was convenient for me, I was surprised at how simple it was.</Review>< pics>

Carly and her office team are consummate professionals. My work in the restoration industry can be challenging at times and for displaced homeowners having competent insurance counsel in this situation is essential. Exceptional customer service, empathy and industry knowledge is a cornerstone of 'Doing it Rite' and Carly's Allstate team.</text>

< Review>
I came to Carly Pickern: Allstate Insurance kind of by accident and BOY AM I GRATEFUL! I've always hated dealing with my insurance chore. With one home, two rentals and two cars to insure, my situation is pretty complicated. For a few years I had stayed with the same lousy phone broker simply because I didn't know any better!  Frankly, the thought of shopping around for all those policies made me have a small panic attack!  That all changed the day I met Angela! She made insurance VERY accessible with clear explanations in plain English. She was so patient when I asked her repeatedly to compare and detail options available. She quickly showed me how my current policies were woefully inadequate. BEST YET the right coverage was not more expensive!  Angela provided great customer service. Her follow through and attention to detail is impeccable.  Maybe it's corny, but I truly feel like I am in good hands! Lol</Review>

Details about vehicle, boat and renter's insurance were not disclosed at time of getting new insurance. Boat insurance was not setup correctly and had to be cancelled and re-done. Roadside assistance vs. towing expenses caused issues. Each "insurance" had to be separated, with separate deposits and separate automated withdrawals, why not have it as one total and one transaction with the total due broken down on an invoice like any other company. Explained frustration to their office, no remorse. Dealing local and in-person is not always the best option I guess. Learning experience and will know to ask three times the amount of questions as I did.<//Review>

{'time': 1550250010428, 'text': 'Hi Jared, I am sorry to hear you felt this way about signing up with our agency.  I was there during your on-boarding and I know we did our absolute best to discuss and thoroughly explain our billing process.  Of course when our customers are dissatisfied we want to do everything in our power to help.  Unfortunately every bill has to be separate to prevent one missed payment from terminating all policies which would be terrible.  I will say we certainly enjoy working with you and moving forward if you have problems please let us know by giving our agency a call.  Sorry we missed your review, otherwise we would have reached out.  We are happy you have chosen to stay with our agency, it means so much to us that you have chosen to do business local.   Wishing you and your family a healthy and happy 2019!'}</Response>

<text>Worked with Zach about 8 months ago setting up an auto and home policy. I was one of the several who was affected by our recent winter storm, suffering some damage to both home and car. Boy am I glad I had Zach when setting everything up! Turns out I had much better coverage than I thought, and all because he took the time to know my situation ahead of time, stay within the payment range I wanted, and cram as much stuff into that as he could. Good looking out man! The rest of the office is just as helpful, I've dealt with at least four people there who are all happy to be helping any client, theirs or not. Thanks for making a stressful time much easier</text></record></dataset><record>

I was fortunate enough to find this agency to help consolidate policies. McKena was absolutely wonderful in getting us a great price on a home policy after having experienced an unfortunate event in our prior home. I can't say enough how much I appreciate her working with me to find a policy that meets our needs, and doing so quickly. McKena was available to answer any questions, explained things clearly,  was accommodating and just extremely nice! I had Allstate for years in the past and am happy to be a returning customer.<//text>

They know you on a first name basis and never make you feel like your needs aren't important.  The whole office is incredibly nice and most importantly, sincere. They really look out for their clients needs. I really appreciate the service, you girls rock!</text>< Name>

Carly and staff are the best in the business. I have referred many clients to her for homeowners insurance and they are always prompt with great rates. We do a lot of 'high fire' area homes and they come through with coverage when others can't. Give them a try, you'll be happy you did.< /review>

We would like to take this opportunity to extend our gratitude to Angela Apodaca for her exceptional help in our move to Shasta county. We were able with Angela’s direction to bundle all of our vehicle and home insurance with ease. Angela truly has been great to work with. Stuart and Yvette Oller</Review>

<Review>We've used Allstate , particularly Perry Pickern and his staff for at lease two decades. I typically and once a year 'go shopping' to see where we stand with our rates compared to other insurance providers. Perry has always given us the best rates with none to compare. His staff is friendly and very knowledgeable .

<Review>tl/dr: Find a different insurance company. Insurance companies who provided fast and good service to friends and family after the Carr Fire: Farmers, State Farm, and Progressive.

After the Carr fire I contacted Carly Pickern's office and submitted an insurance claim due to smoke and ash damages to my house due to the Carr Fire, which was declared a state of emergency. During the fire, my house and the homes of my neighbors were covered with black smoke, ash, high heat temperatures, and was inundated with harmful and poisonous particulates and literal burnt pieces of homes that were lost in my neighborhood and surrounding homes. Overall, ash, burnt home debris and thick smoke covered my home from early July to Mid-October 2018.

Carly Pickern's office basically insured my home through a third party, Pacific Specialty, so I was directed to speak with them about my claim.

After submitting the claim, I spent several months on the phone and over emails with Pacific Specialty Insurance trying to make my position on the claim that my house needs the appropriate attention by fire and smoke restoration cleaning company. My claim was evaluated, by Pacific Specialty, and they came to the conclusion that they would only clean the outside of my home and denied any cleaning of the interior of my home, specifically the carpet, floors, and walls. I have two children so I was concerned about the ash and poisonous material that entered my home and was covering my floors, walls, and possibly furniture. Two separate inspectors from Service Master came on two separate occasions, once at my request and once at the Pacific Specialty's request. They both stated by home should be cleaned top to bottom. Pacific Specialty disagreed and offered a payment in the amount of $2854.77 minus $1000.0 deductible to clean the exterior of the home.

After Pacific Specialty refused to clean the interior of my home, I contacted Carly Pickern's office and spoke to her. She said she agreed with my claim and apologized for issues I was having with Pacific Specialty. She said she would contact them and attempt to resolve the issue. She contacted me a few days later and let me know there was nothing she could do and that I would just have to fight the claim with Pacific Specialty.

So while the majority of my issue is with Pacific Specialty, this problem also with them also reflects on Allstate and Carly's office. It made me think, "Why am I paying her office if she is unable to assist with home insurance related issues? Why am I paying her office so she can insure me through another company?"

In addition to the above information, I spoke with friends and family who all had insurance related claims. Every single one of them informed me their insurance company's called them within a few days of the fire and evacuation to ask if they were ok and if they would like to file a claim. Carly's office never contacted me prior to my call to them. Further, they all received payouts extremely fast in order to resolve their ash, smoke, suit issues.

I was finally paid out this month (May 2019) after filing the original claim in July 2018. I had to go through the California Department of Insurance and deal with lawyers before they decided to provide an insurance payment. I received much less then what was needed, but I was tired of dealing with this issue and just wanted it resolved.</Review><date>1558482153853<//date>< user_id>

<Resp>{'time': 1560196918894, 'text': 'Kris we worked really hard advocating for you with Pacific Specialty in order to get your interior carpets cleaned.  You and I had several conversations about your claim and I made many many calls on your behalf.  I called the claims manager of CA and the General Manager of Pacific Specialty on your behalf in an attempt to get your interior cleaning approved.  One of the processes of the interior inspection is for a hygienist to come into the home, as they did with you, and to swipe multiple areas with a sponge and to send the sponge off to a lab to be tested for smoke, soot, and ash.  The lab is a third party vendor which has no connection to an insurance company.  The lab found that the interior of your home has less than 1% smoke soot and ash debris and with this finding Pacific Specialty would not clean the interiors but they did pay to clean the exterior of the home.  The local vendors who deal with smoke soot and ash clean up do NOT test when they swipe the interior and are always quick to say the home needs to be cleaned by your insurance company in order to make a quick buck.  It is unfortunate you feel we did not advocate for you because we absolutely did.  During the Carr fire our agency worked three weeks straight calling customers and filing claims, not one day off.  It is also sad to see you post this here especially since our conversations were cordial and I thought you understood I was doing everything we could to help you.  We wish you well moving forward and wish the situation would have turned out differently.'}< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>Horrible service!!  We have been with this company since 1999.  They screwed up our account when they set us up for easy pay.  The acct. lapsed .  They called us and told us the acct lapsed and to get insurance again we would have to pay $585.  I gave them my card and told them we needed insurance.  I called today to see if it went thru and they said it didn't.  I then contacted another insurance companhy and got insurance.  I then called Shaun at the Carly Pickern office and said I needed the refund of the $585 I just paid them as they took it out of my account.  She informed me they gave me a courtesy insurance from Feb thru April.  I said I don't want that.  Those dates are already gone.... it's May.  If I would have had an accident they wouldn't have covered me but now that the time is past they will apply ,what was suppose to be to start anew policy, to past dates?  I have filed a complaint with the California Dept of Insurance.  I have talked to my new insurance agent with Farmers and he said it is unethical.  STAY AWAY FROM CARLY PICKERNS OFFICE!!  It was great when Perry was there.... guess not so much now that Carly is running it.  I will make sure I tell everyone the experience I have had here.  Unbeleiveable after being insured there since 1999.< /text>< Pics>

It's funny, while doing this survey I realized that none of #3 happened to me and in fact, that might be part of why I enjoyed this experience so much.  I was welcomed the minute I stepped in and did not feel like I was pushed constantly to be 'upsold' on anything which I appreciate.  They did make sure to tell me that they would do a safety inspection for me, rotate the tires and I had my plate in the back window and they offered to install it for me.  I have to tell you...EVERY person I encountered at this shop was polite and helpful.  I felt I could trust them and that they had my best interest at heart.  I drive nearly an hour to get to this location...and will again.  I have already told others.  This was the best experience I have had at a shop of any kind in years.<//text>

<Text>Kind of surprised by the question "was I offered a free alignment" ... I was offered a pay alignment and notified that there would be a charge associated with the assessment of whether one was needed.  The service fees seems kinda of high a $100 to install two tires.  I'll probably just purchase my next set of tires at SamsClub moving forward.

Big O definitely knows the product and was kind enough to remove lugs locks for another $60.  The service people seemed friendly enough but it was clear that they weren't there to save me anything because there were no options or education shared towards that point.<//Text><Date>1565376521979</Date><userid>118302945535761711841<//userid>< user_name>

<review>Bought set of 4 tires from them with added warranty.

One of the tires was defective due to Radial Tire Pull.  Ben Ly, the GM (or just manager), states it's not "defective" (after admitting that's what the issue is) and I am not getting a new tire.  Told him that's unethical and not right, so he asks me to leave the store.  I have filed a complaint with both the Better Business Bureau and Big O Tires Corporate.

Last time me or my family will ever go here.  Just go to Les Schwab.  It'll save you time and money.<//review>< Pics>

When getting an estimate I told them what I would be using my SUV for and what they recommend. Their recommendation was perfect, I love the Big O, Big Foot tires they sold me and they were a great price. Thanks you guys for the amazing alignment. My SUV handles better now than when I bought it!!! I will be getting all of my repairs done by them from now on!!!!< /Review>

<Text>I stopped by with 2 tires with problems.  They were able to fix the slow leak but the other had a damaged sidewall and they didn't have the tire in stock to warranty out. They were very helpful to find where I could go so I wouldn't have to wait until the next day.  Very professional as I have come to expect from Big O.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1509041867750, 'text': 'Thanks for leaving us such a great review, Patrick!

I eat here a lot since I work in the area. I got to say the service is always fantastic and they keep the spot neat consistently. Pricing is fair and they serve sizeable portions.< /review>

This restaurant is my preferred one. I go to many restaurants but to this place I go the most. The crew is very cordial and the cuisine they place on your table is so appetizing. I never decline to have a decent dinner in this place. I highly recommend this place.<//Text>

This used to be my usual place to go and food used to be very good. Recently not sure if the management changed or something. The food tastes very bad. It was not the usual chicken kebab. It was just boiled chicken and food also did not have any salt or spice. When checked with the person in the shop, got a very carefree response and she was not bothered. Very bad experience. Very unhappy.</text>

The hummus and falafel are bland and the gyro is really dry devoid of flavor. Service is at best they do the bare minimum and at worst they have a bad attitude even on a slow day.< /Review>

The only boba place I saw in Great Mall. The place is around the corner to the food pavilion. Since it was a weekday afternoon there was no rush, but had to wait quite sometime coz there was only one person behind the counter.

Tried a medium strawberry smoothie with boba add-on. I wanted less ice, which they politely said was not possible. Anyways the smoothie was prepared using sugary strawberry puree and not fresh cut fruits. The taste was good and the smoothie was thick with a lot of boba in it.<//review>

Terrible shawarmas. Not really shawarmas. It is gyros but they sell it as a shawarma. I asked explicitly if it is a shawarma and they said yes. Never coming again.</text>

One of the best restaurant inside great mall. I loved the taste of shavarma. I always order wrap because in plate option they add more rice than chicken. If you like rice then better to order plate. Both having good taste. Higher recommend.< /Text>

These guys dont know how to run a shawarma place. Instead of giving fresh from the rotisserie they cut the meat off and keep it on the counter till it cools down and then they wrap and then again leave it on the counter and after 5 minutes they remember and put the wrapped stuff on the grill to heat it. The geniuses dont realize that it won't heat through the insulating paper. Net result cold chicken in a shawarma wrap. If I want a cold sandwich why am I standing for 10 minutes instead of grabbing something  from a vending machine</review>

Halal meat is served here.  Verbal assurance from staff and also visible signs stating Halal. Sam's combo plate is good with chicken, lamb and skewers with rice and salad.  The shawerma wraps are pretty good too.  They also have bubble tea.  The slushies are good on a hot day.  Try the Lychee flavor.<//Text>

Love this place. Solid steak meal for those on a budget. I always get the stockyard. Too bad it's closing... Pasadena is getting too expensive $$$</review>

The place looks like 1972 but that's what Iike ! Service was good and so was the food. Laid back relaxing atmosphere when you need a break from all of the trendy restaurants<//Text>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Closed February 2, 2019. Had been there  42 years as a steak restaurant.  Not extremely expensive nor cheap. They don't make places with steak, chicken and fish menu choices like these any more.  Free parking and being right off the 210 freeway made it a convenient location. It is missed.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Been going here for years and usually we enjoy very much. Very often we have referred people here.... However the last few times we have been the food has taken  decline in quality . It's been since the price increase which wasn't bad because as I used to tell everyone the amount of food And the quality of it is worth every penny but sad to say that  is NOT THE CASE anymore!!!! So to say we may need to find a new lil steak house. 😿< /review>

We love this place! Great food. We often get the plank steak for two. The service is attentive and the portions are a good size. Reminds me of restaurants I grew up with. It's not modern, but sometimes that's a good thing.< /text>

Got seated right away but the server left us sitting too long. Food wasn't special. The best part of the meal were the Zucchini sticks and the Sangria. I won't go back there</text>

Excellent Healthiest Teriyaki Chicken Salad with Fresh mushrooms, cabbage, pickles, ranch dressing.  My favorite salad.  I took the rest home for dinner and added dried cranberries and cashews and mixed it up.  So delicious the second time around.  I'm a new and returning customer.< /review>

<text>This place changed the salad was plane nothing but lettuce and ranch. The kids cheese burgers had nothing in them but the bun cheese and meat. The chicken had no flavor  was grilled but nothing not even salt and pepper. This was a waste of money I really used to love this place don't waste your money< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The server we had was great. The steaks were cheap cuts and overpriced, the quality wasn't there, no seasoning their chili soup or steaks. My wife's steak looked like a long sausage instead of a steak, my son's steak was still raw in the middle...a little disappointed since this was my first time here and had heard such good things. I know its no Ruth Kris or Houston's, but to be honest would've gotten a better steak at Applebees...<//Review>< pics>

<Review>After 30 years of patronage I still call this my go to spot for consistently good food and excellent service. Despite ownership changes the place has retained it's original charm. Portions and prices are very good. One thing though, the men's room is a travesty and is dark, damp with stains and dirty floors.  I hope the owner takes note and improves it.< /Review>< rate>

This place used to have good food. Their steaks are now inedible. Everything on the menu is such garbage, I wouldn't feed it to a stray rat. All the food (especially beef) is over-salted under the pretense that it's "tenderizer." Waitress is polite and helpful as can be. But if you complain about salt, the owner in front lets you pick something else off menu which is still salty... just maybe not drowning in a mountain of salt. The owner should rip the sign off the front and put up a new one that says "Heart Disease n' Ale." Avoid this place like the plague unless you want to o.d. on msg.< /text><Rating>1</Rating><user_name>Heidi Martorano</user_name>< Pictures>

<Text>It has an old mid Western feel about it like something you'd find like in an Arkansas BBQ joint. The steaks where slow but good and the drinks were always full just expect on a slow day (meaning 15 people in a restaurant rated to seat 10 times that) expect it to take your meal Time at least 90 minutes<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
The waitress was very rude.  She over charged me for a specialty steak when I specifically asked for a lunch special.  When I alerted her of her mistake she did not correct my ticket nor did she apologize.  She even had the audacity to ask if I had received change after paying my outrageous lunch bill.  This place is awful.  I will never come here again.</Review>

Very disappointed use to love this place and service was terrible...Management needs to teach their employees  some customer service....place was not packed ...the guy that sat us was a little more helpful no one ever came to ask us what we wanted to drink the guy that sat us came to ask us if we had been helped yet we said no.....so he brought us our drinks and said someone would be with us......after a while pasted still no one came to at least say I'll be right with you in a second....by then I tolded my husband were leaving...so sad that this happened .....Left and ended up at Conrads on Lake very attentive  Great Customer Service st Conrads now they know how to treat their customers.< /Text>

<Review>They were terrible cooks there, I asked for stockyard steak and wanted it medium, it came to the table bloody rare... I sent my steak back 2 times and the 3rd time I gave up and said for them to cancel my order... My daughter wanted med-rare she got Rare, in fact, Really, Realy Rare... My husband wanted Rare, he got well-done, the mushrooms were burnt, the baked potatoe was over done and flooded with butter, the veg were terrible...the women's bathroom had no soap and a  broken wall and the men's bathroom had a broken sink ... I Do NOT RECOMMEND GOING TO This Resturant</Review>< user>

< Review>
Where to begin This place is failing on all levels. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! HORRIBLE FOOD, HORRIBLE SERVICE, HORRIBLE OWNER !!! BEWARE YOU WILL GET SICK !!!!!
I took my family here for a meal yesterday and I would have been better off going to Jack in a Box for Steak.

We walked in and were seated our waitress couldn't have been more rude or brainless she didn't even introduce herself so I couldn't tell you her name. She was talking our order fighting about prices and didn't even know there own menu.

Ordered a Filet without bacon medium rare
got bacon wrapped over done filet
Sent it back
asked for the manger and was informed they have the owner there
she walks to the other waitress and says oh they just want to complain
owner comes out tells me I shouldn't complain before I get my food and brings to the table an
over done Filet
I send it back
everyone else at the Table is now eating
I get another steak brought out by the owner now raw different color than all the other filets that have been brought to my table and different size. There's no way in hell I got a filet the meat was rubbery salty and horrible. The baked potato was yellow and could tell that it was left over from the day before.
Not only did I have to pay full price but we were treated like trash.
*this didn't happen to me but the poor old woman and her son were there at the same time as we were she had her breathing machine the same brainless waitress took their order they went to the bathroom and when they had come back the stupid waitress had sat other people in their seats they were so upset and she couldn't hardly walk.

After we left  we all got horrible food poisoning puking diarrhea the whole nine yards. Called to speak with the owner and he hung up on us 3 yes 3 times and refuses to give us a refund for horrible service and making us sick.

So in conclusion if you would like to eat food you wouldn't even serve to a dog and be belittled this is the place to go. Also be ready to be sick and get falsely advertised pieces of meat. if you can call it that.

To the owner of Steer N Ale do everyone a favor and close the door you have no idea what a steakhouse is supposed to be plus you are rude and obviously not a good business man.<//Review>

< Review>
After driving 40 minutes to visit and pick up information for my stay in San Diego there was a sign on the door saying closed until further notice due to the pandemic. I understand the difficulty around that issue but please update your website.  Thank you for leaving a few brochures in the box outside.< /Review>

This allows them to pick and choose where they'd like to go. Even though I'm a local, the friendly staff still take the time to help me. During my visits, I still find out about new places to check out with my own boys during school breaks. This location is great because it's next to the 5 freeway and sits on Pacific Coast Highway (California U.S. Route 101) next door to an In-N-Out Burgers.< /Text><response>None<//response>< Pics>

We are one of the State's official visitor centers and have a variety of information about things to see and do throughout California and the local region.  Travelers are invited to stop in and stretch their legs, use the restroom, and learn more about the area.  For those seeking more traditional rest area amenities, there is a wonderful rest area located just 2 miles north of our visitor center. Thank you! :)"}<//resp>< username>

This is not a highway rest area, even though there are official signs for it on I-5. Reasonably close to I-5, pleasent staff. Clean restroom. I did not stay long. If you want to know about the local area, then stop here. If you need to use the restroom, go 3 miles north on I-5 to the actual rest stop.<//text>

Excellent place for information on places throughout California, not just around Oceanside. The staff is experienced, very pleasant and eager to help you. You will leave with a bag stuffed with maps and information.<//review>

As one of 100+ volunteers at the CWC I highly recommend locals and visitors alike to stop in. Brochures, maps, suggestions for things to do in Oceanside and the greater San Diego are available. Boutique candles, soaps, jewelry, seasonal items, shirts hats, and toys are a favorite of mine for shopping.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The Welcome Center is very practical and informative for tourists. You get any information, there is also a service point for cyclists with air pump and tools which is very practical.

(Translated by Google) The friendly staff are very fond of promoting California to visitors. The brochure contains coupons from stores, so take a closer look. If you look closely, there are also brochures in Korean.

친절한 직원들이 정성을 다해 방문객들에게 캘리포니아를 홍보한다. 안내책자에는 상점들의 쿠폰이 있으니 자세히 살펴보는 게 좋다. 잘 찾아보면 한글로된 안내책자도 있다.<//text>

Lots of good DJ gear stock. The lighting showroom was awesome. Super friendly staff with really good prices. Ended up leaving with a great Pioneer mixer. Definitely coming back for any new equipment I might need.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I am a customer who came from Louisiana and was on the search for a wholesale dj shop. When I walked in I was approached by Josh. Josh is awesome! He talked me through all of the gear in the shop. He is honest and way more reliable than the other dj stores on this street by far who were looking for a quick dollar. The prices are very fair and the customer service is on point. I am a lifetime customer now! Thank you guys for your help.< /text>< Pics>

Sonido Live has products not available in Canada and my biggest concern was the shipping and import fees associated with the purchase. Mr. Josh from business development help me with my purchases and even called UPS and customs to question why the import and shipping fees were so high. In the end, he saved me about $100 and that’s good with me. Sonidolive is my go to shop even though they’re thousands of kilometres away. If you have any concerns with your purchase, just ask and you will be taken care of. Thanks Josh and Sonidolive.<//text>

I’ve been coming to this gym for over a year and overall I love it But recently the new manager has been something else.. The Manager Jay is extremely rude and over exaggerated at times.. I was trying to ask him a simple question and he just jumped back like 10 Steps Even though we were already 6 ft apart.. Won’t be coming back until change happens.< /text>

The classes are the best part of the gym. The class teachers are fantastic - all well trained and fully prepared for each class. The schedule and variety of classes are great. Who ever is in charge of this program for inShape deserves a lot of credit for running a great program and keeping everything consistent and reliable.Classes are the best way to succeed at the gym. I recommend In Shape to everyone and evangelize the classes especially and the best way to make exercising a permanent part of their lives.</text>

I would have given more stars but the smell of the facility especially the sauna is Atrocious.  I love the machines and the SET-UP of the whole gym is why it got 2 stars. I tried reaching out to management but they never called back. Coffee road is not perfect but it’s far superior then here. No towels ready for you. You have to go to the front desk for one and only one. But that’s nothing compared to the smell in the sauna   It was like decay smell. That’s as nice as I could put it. The shower is nice but coffee road gives ya ladies lovely smelling shampoo and conditioner and body wash to use.  I would go back for only the equipment and leave and not use the sauna and or pool but not rest of the facility.  Employees at coffee are also super nice and smile and just a friendlier atmosphere.  I just can’t get over that smell it’s there as you walk in.< /Review>

At the time of leaving the gym I asked the  front desk to run the free bottle water barcode on my device. She did. But she asked me to run my membership scanner once more as a verification  as I did at the arrival time!!?
Is it a part of picking up the rewarded items by In shape!?I  was about to present my photo ID to her for more verification purpose!!?
I think she must treat the clients with  no attitude first and much more  in professionally
manner.

Hello, I have been a membership at In-Shape for 5 years , I have stayed there because of the great customer service and over all experience, but today on 07/06/2020 I had a very bad experience with one of the employees, due to covid 19 I took off my mask to get a grasp of air and jay from In-Shape on California Ave in Bakersfield ca was very disrespectful he called me into his office and humiliated me like if I was a child he asked me to sit up straight and demanding things just because he was manager , to the point where I felt so uncomfortable I had to cancel my membership, he was African American and I feel like he was being racial towards me.</Review>

Honestly, I believe this In-Shape location is one of the best here in Bakersfield!!! Wish they had a few more Zumba classes with Andrew dance fever. But overall I would say this location is the cleanest, the staff there are the friendlliest, and the machines are never out of order,. When they are they’re fixed in a timely manner!

<Text>The gym itself is pretty clean. The staff friendly. One HUGE problem though is that the lap pool area has pretty much become the community pool/ rec center. Lots of children hanging on the ropes, jumping into lap lanes, rowdy and loud. Matter of fact there has been a broken and missing lap lane for at least a couple of weeks. Also they do not enforce the "no street shoes" rule ever. So we go in for a clean sweat and have to sit where dirty shoes with street filth have been. Plus the shoes stink up the air in a really gross way. It's ashame to see this lack of attention. On the plus side they keep the water clean, especially the Jacuzzi. Would love to see some improvement in pool area. Some final notes: The water in pool is kept way to warm for any kind of serious lap swimming. Crazy warm. The gym area and locker rooms are kept clean most of the time. This is a definite plus.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

This was my 2nd visit back after an absence of about 9 months due to serious health issues.  It was wonderful! It felt great seeing all the old faces and meeting new people.  The best part was finally doing a small workout and feeling energized afterwards.  Previously I only did the aquatic class but I intend to start basic yoga, do a small 29 minute cardio workout, and do one aquatic class a week. It's ambitious but that's my goals and I know I can achieve them at this gym. It's always clean, I love the pool, and the instructors are all excellent. So to me, this is the best investment in my health I can make and I am 60 years old.<//Review>

Came around 6:30pm a wednesday night.came to cash in a check but the lady kept telling me her computer was crashing. Waited at least 15mins to get a response from her(. I always change my checks here) she finally told me that company wasn’t in the system. I told her I could give her my bosses phone number to confirm the check. She just brushed it off and told me she wasn’t gonna be able too.Kinda disappointed she didn’t reach out to help her customer out......< /Review>

< Review>
Got here on a Sunday at 2:55 pm the hours of operation for a Sunday according to the outside of the building say 10-3 pm. I am here and they are closed. I'm asking the girl inside if they are closed and as soon as I say it is not 3 she turns around and ignores me. Very frustrating at least put a sign outside saying you're closing early!<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!

We were visiting my parents from SD, came here because of the great reviews...🤬  you gotta be kidding me, the smallest Burrito I had ever seen.... ever! (Picture compared to my tiny hand) My husband ask to confirm the price and they told him it was gonna be $6.50, but when my husband ask for NO rice and beans, they told him it was gonna be $10 instead, my husband was already upset they have changed the price, but he was furious after seen the size of that burrito, if you can call it that. Obviously the regular size burrito must be all rice and beans, because they end up overcharging him for half a burrito, that actually ONLY had meat, onions & cilantro on it.... nothing else. Worst customer service, defenetly not coming back here ever!!!!!!

Update: was NOT a carne asada burrito, not sure what it was, it was greasy & NO taste whatsoever, got a stomachache and end up throwing it away. So disappointed, I was looking forward to eating one after my C. Treatment. 😭</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnaNizClnBixYJX5mAeXBF6brjUUvw7qr0Jp6W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONhSrT706_lsxJq8Q3XOeQenCGRF5H13h8mWcX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWoXYEKaatrWCCuOFT-cW-tFL1vmH225GL9X2v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

<Review>I have been coming here for two years now, since living in the high dessert. Located just off the freeway you can't miss what the place serves. If you're looking for Mexican comfort food - street taco style cuisine, THIS IS THE PLACE that never has disappointed me. Every order i have ever placed was good, average to go wait time 10-12 minutes.< /Review>< pics>

<review>The tacos were loaded with grilled chicken and a ton of cilantro plus white onions. Adding a bit of the fresh lime juice and a mix of their red and green homemade salsa made them so incredible tasty and mouthwatering, I loved the way they tasted and this all for under $12 each.< /review><rate>5</rate>< GmapID>

I love their food! I always order tacos al pastor. I've tried tacos at other places but I feel like the meat is too dry or too hard to chew sometimes.  but this ones are just the way I like them. To drink i get either a glass bottle coke or orchata.< /review>

I would give more stars if I could. I'm only sorry I don't live in the area any more just so I could come back for more.
They were busy and it's a wait for food, but worth it.< /Text>

If I'm craving a torta in the middle of the night, this is the spot! It might be a little sketchy after 12am sometimes but you're good! I always get their torta de asada w/o avocado. Their meat is always seasoned and cooked perfectly. If you like salsa roja ask for extra bc their salsa roja is amazing!! Spicy but delicious.< /Review>

Worst tacos I've ever had, I got 2 steak and 2 Carne Asada. The steak tasted like unseasoned old chicken and was beige and the Carna Asada didn't taste much of anything. Both had onions and very little cilantro  and none of them had a sauce and didn't come with pico. Rice didn't taste of much,  and come on the gray refried beans were disgusting. First and last time customer.</Text>

One of my favorite spots. Up here and There's not that many, but unfortunately when ever is answering ther phone orders has the worst customer service ever shes rude hangs up or straight tells you you can't order over the phone. You guys have good food and most of the time very nice but today after calling 2 left on hold for 20 min then got hung up on I don't think I will continue to go there.. Management needs to address the issue and get her of the phone and in the back were shes not dealing with loyal customers.< /text>

I spent $70 here on tacos came back in because they forgot 2 of my tacos. Instead of making me the 2 they forgot, they treated me like a liar. Wanted to search with their hands all through my tacos in the middle of a pandemic!!! Like are you kidding me! I kindly asked for a refund.

I can't visit Bullhead and not stop at El Charro Restaurant...
They make the most delicious handmade CORN && FLOWER TORTILLAS in this State HANDS down!!! To top it off, they have 4 DELICIOUS Salsa's and one of the 4 is 🔥🔥🔥 I couldn't tell you about the desert because I could never get that far, what i can say is their service exceeds most restaurants!</Text>

Attention raza!!! Do not support this restaurant. They do not give lunch breaks to their employees. They only have 15 minutes to eat and rest. The owner takes advantage of the employees and they don’t get paid well either. The only way they will learn is if you stop supporting them.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽<//text>

<Text>So my first visit was great , no issues with the food or service. So I decided to go back a few days later.
Second visit The food was tasted good but we got sick from the chicken tacos. I’m not sure where they got the chicken from but it definitely wasn’t cooked fresh. Also the cashier didn’t seem like she wanted to be there.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>I was disappointed they didn't do hard shell shredded beef tacos, which is what I was searching for, but the street tacos we did get were pretty damn good. I had 2 al pastor and 2 carne asada tacos, one kid had chicken, and the rest of the kids did carne asada with guac on them and we were all licking our fingers clean. I did think the place was a bit dirty in various areas, otherwise I Would be given them a 5.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNThYNRO4OlPPmq28c6WKM8QM4NH9gIKnY5rDuV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMthPGKOzMxDpX9usjDpD93dNjIkMXNvXvWy4y6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrFU6AtXlSxLQTJM449ZaFEc9bBaKhaz-liBBk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSAjTPTf7ObggZgmXyVrq1Y4Q3SLrCJMLjX-3L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3tnPBg3z-58B3iMeB6yxgUTmR18nErUnj_4Xz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVlV_ahafySTVdrJwKh_dbg2hwcawGA30DGr9X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

The tacos where good and there pretty good at giving you your order in timely manner but the place itself was okay. The desk and chair were all written and marked and scratched as if it was taken out a high school detention center. But it was good food< /review>

A bit pricey but a price I'm willing to pay for great tasting mexican food. The price justifies the top quality of the meats here. My wife is really picky when it comes to food but not here. Friendly staff and a local favorite spot.</text>

I ordered the lengua fries because they look so good in the picture. I was sorely disappointed, frozen crinkle-cut fries with cheese sauce that looks like Dollar Store mac and cheese. Bland and flavorless, except the lengua that tastes like dirty dishwater. I've never eaten here before, and I'm never going to eat here again<//text>

The carne asada tacos are great,  but what I didn't like was the carne asada fries.  The cheese sauce was too watery,  as was the guacamole.< /Review>

Beans have always been freshly prepped, not one visit have I experienced stale ingredients. This is a good spot for simple tacos. I have yet to find another place that triggers my urge to revisit. Open late. Area is kind of questionable. Staff is also nice. If I crave, this is the one to visit (in the daytime).<//Text><time>1546131973487<//time>< user>

One of the only 24 Hr places to go to for food if you want some Mexican food and to dine-in. Food was really good for what I've ordered but the cashier I dealt with wasnt as efficient as I'd liked was the only problem I had. Salsa is really good and really hot which I like. It's hard to find a salsa here in the desert that doesn't just cater to Caucasian people who like anything mild or de-seeded.< /Review>

Well this is the first time that I've gone to Tacos Mexico. I found myself on the road headed home and wanted to eat. But I did not want to eat my regular burger or fast food. I just happened to be passing by Taco Mexico next to the entrance to the Highway 15 South so I decide to go there and get a couple tacos. I noticed that the tacos were a little small so I got a burrito to go along with it. The people that work there were friendly and courteous I received my taco my burrito and some green sauce and some napkins and my soda. All I can say the food tasted great to me I had no complaints at all. And I invite everyone in the area. I would invite everyone in the area to give it a try. Good things come in small packages and restaurants it appears. Enjoy
Oh the only reason that I gave a Taco Mexico 4 out of 5 Stars was that the whole time I was there I was a bit cold I think the air conditioner was on and it was still just know just a little bit cold for me otherwise I enjoy the whole time I was there. And the bathroom was clean.

Cashier like to argue with customers ,the young lady don't understand true guest service she thinks no matter what she right. I ordered two meat burritos but she told me I ordered with beans wouldn't stand down even in front a whole dinning room full of people these kind of people don't belong in front of guest.  The cook behind the counter had to ask let me make for you and apologized she just told that she to clean the tables could I move very bad example of guest service this was one of the worst cashier I've ever experienced<//Review>

Very good. But for a 1.50 the tacos can be bigger. And if you'd like a different meat. The price goes up also. Overall good.<//text>

Mediocre "Fast Food". not a lot of flavor. Staff knows how to roll a burrito to make it seem like it's big and full. Not a place to bring a date, just a fodder stop when hungry and nothing else is open.  It used to be a good place, back in 2012.</review>

<Review>First time going to this place. I expected so much more I ordered an asada,buche, tripa and chicken. Let me tell you my tacos were so GREASY they were drenched in oil. Yes, I know tacos should be a little greasy but these were super drenched in oil. Which made the tacos nasty and uneditable. Never coming here again.<//Review>< rate>

<text>If it's late and you have a taco/torta/sope/burrito craving then there's really nothing else. It's not really good but it's really not bad. Also its questionable when you are coming here late since it's pretty shady come nightfall. I say dont come by yourself, and if you do, come with the Heater. It's a shame since Castaneadas is literally walking distance from my house, but they'll get the review that's due soon.</text>< user_id>

The service is great. Clean enough place. The burrito was way to spicy. I like spice but your average carne asada burrito should not be that hot with out warning.< /text>

The food here is terrible cashier lady is very rude yelling at all the customers because of the mixed up order numbers. Restrooms are also very nasty. In the mens room the sink doesn't flow out properly so it takes a long time to rinse your hands. Save your money i dont recommend this</Text>

<text>Food was good. Would definitely go back. Tripas were good, but a little too crispy for my taste, I will ask if they can make them a little less crispy next time. Pollo asado was good as well. Red sauce had a good spice to it and green sauce wasn't spicy, but still had a good taste. Wait time was about average. Food was warm when it was brouhy out.</text><Resp>None<//Resp><Time>1559715884843</Time><user>111287976622774900873<//user><Gmap_id>0x80c3663f6ed8acd1:0xfc56fa58e16fa5e3<//Gmap_id>< pics>

Had machaca burrito with no rice n very little beans, n pico de gallo, just like I asked for. Was one of the best burritos I've ever eaten, and I've been eatin' them for over 50yrs.
Fam had torta, quesadillas...
No complaints at all.
Was busy.
Good service.</review>

COUNT YOUR TACOS IF YOU ORDER TO GO! I’m a local and for years when one orders to go, they intentionally will short your order. Several times we have been short 3 tacos. Tacos are ok but nothing like El Atacor.< /text>

Tortilla tasted fake, hash browns compared to that of McDonald's, beans were a little too soupy for a burrito and were mediocre. Eggs were pretty alright. Best part was the sour cream. One of the saddest burritos I've ever had.</review>< rating>

No long line but there always busy 247. They got a security guard manning the door so I didn't feel unsafe like it use to be. Clean tables n booths for dine in. And friendly staff who all speak English n Spanish perfectly. Good size portions for the carni asada nachos. They are a must. Everyone's #1 stop in the HD for 247 real authentic Mexican food.</Text>

Always a Great Food Experience,  Sadly they Use Nacho Cheese Sauce on the Asada Fries. Meat is full of Flavor and Burritos are decent size.< /Review>

My daughter woke up the next day throwing up then my son, spouse and myself had big time diarhea amd stomache cramps along with throwing up. This place is the cause for sure!!! I will never eat there again. My wife is pregnant and suffered pretty bad stomache cramps. The food came out way to fast! Plus, it wasn't even good. So not worth the foos poisoning episodes we all took home with us. My advice. It's dirty. Go somewhere else!!!!!!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
The food was absolutely disgusting I took one bite threw it away and I left. So-called Mexican food taste like ass but I guess that's what you get when you hire dumbshit's that are running it. All they're worried about is the new chronic they got from the dispensary and it's in my car I want to hit it on my break. This place is not recommended for any kind of food consumption.< /Review>

Tacos Mexico being one of two things open. I wish we would have choose del taco instead.
In short, just a horrible example of Mexican fast food tacos.
Cold,  dry ,crunchy and tastless meat. salsa was watery and bland. exreamly small portions were served. this place SUXKS! I would not stop and eat here again if they were giving it away FREE!</text></record>

Awful quality food. Had some tacos al pastor and they were just one step above Taco Bell as far as authentic Mexican food.  Their nachos were just a mess. For some reason I thought these guys were King Taco; not a mistake I'll make again.</review>

Food is o.k , my problem is Everytime i order  Al Pastor Burrito. They give me a Carne Asada burrito. I don't drive Across town to get something i didn't order. I always order the same 2 Al pastor Tacos & Al Pastor Burrito . They get my Tacos order right. But Give me WRONG Burrito . This is the 3rd & final time i come here. Even after bringing Their error to attention  They Continue to Screw up. PLEASE Talk to your EMPLOYEES. Give The Customers What they order. Not to hard.<//Text>

Really good food, good prices, but the credit card machine is always down so bring cash. That's my only complaint.<//text>

Not impressed, but maybe I didn't order the right things. I tried several meats in tacos with the idea that I was going to get a burrito to go with the meat I liked the best from the tacos I'd tried. I tried the carne asada, langua, carnitas, al pastor, and a couple others. I left without getting the burrito, and went somewhere else to get more food. I wouldn't go back to this place. The other places like los alazones, and all the Alberto clones are way better, and in some cases much better priced.<//text>

Love taco mexico so i used to go to the one in san bernardino until they changed owners and food kinda changed so i moved to high desert and seen this one so i wanted to try. The food is great like i remembered but customer service kinda sucked. Me and my brother only ordered 2 little tacos each and it took almost 20min other customers that came after were getting there food before us. And when we recieved our food it wasnt even hot😞</Review>

<text>They don't serve the plates as shown in the pictures, you have to pay extra for the cream and other stuff that is supposed to be in the plate already , and the girl attending even gets mad if you tell her about it. Me and my family are not going back there to eat again.</text>< pictures>

No recomendado..  pedimos gorditas de carnitas y de adobada y oh! Decepcion 😪 nada que ver con lo que son las auténticas gorditas mexicanas,  muy falsas .. masa dura como tostadas, y aparte la agua de horchata es el sabor de las  aguas zuco de sobre de supermercado .  No pierdas tu dinero, ni tu tiempo.. 🥴🤢🤮<//text>

(Translated by Google) They charge you for the avocado on a Mexican cake. Very bad attention. I asked for my shepherd's cake well browned and they didn't want to make me. I disrespectfully charge 1.45 for adding avocado when originally it has to be brought. Cakes were invented in Mexico and this part of Mexico has no respect for its traditions.

(Original)
Te cobran el aguacate en una torta mexicana. Muy mal atención. Pedí mi torta de pastor bien doradito y no me lo quisieron hacer. Se me hace una falta de mucho respeto el cobrar 1.45 por ponerle aguacate cuando originalmente lo tiene que llevar. Las tortas se inventaron en México y este lugar de México no tiene ni el respeto por sus tradiciones.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I been going from mexican restaurant to another mexican restaurant and this is the best home made MENUDO.
I've been testing from one restaurant to another often. And this one of TACOS MEXICO, is the Best of the Major MENUDO, which I have tried. It does not have so much fat, the meat is soft and the flavor of the broth is original. Simply PERFECT, almost good. Hahaha Advantage.

The service of the staff seems that one asks them for the food given away.
