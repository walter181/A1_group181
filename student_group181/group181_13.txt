I love Ulta but I’ve had several experiences where customer service was lacking. The people at this location are rude and unhelpful. No common curtesy. The Ulta in Sand City is excellent. The associate went out of her way to help me, told me about the current sales/deals and was kind. It’s worth the drive from Salinas. I won’t ever go back to the Salinas location.< /review>

<Text>got my hair done by Mayra loved it. she did a great job on my hair. she explained everything to me. i love the way she cut my hair. she took her time and styled by hair very nice. i have never been able to curl my hair and the curls stay in. my hair was really long and thick, its been years since its had any TLC. i must say i was really nervous to get my hair done. but once i sat down and talked to Mayra i felt much better. she cut exactly what needed to be cut and nothing more. so my hair is still long but now healthy. my hair used to be so thick and heavy mostly, its still thick but she did something wonderful that my hair isn't as heavy as it was. I cant express how much i love my hair now. i always had my hair up before, not no more i love to show it off now. at the end of my cut she even referred what shampoo and conditioner would be great for my hair. this was my first visit with their salon and i will be going back every 3 months as needed. plus for your first visit you get 15% off which was awesome. the only thing that was a bummer was i didn't get my sample bag that your suppose to get on your visit. i was really looking forward to that, i mean after spending all that money, it would have been nice to get something for free. its kinda a thank you for spending with us.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I don't know why Ulta as a whole insists on only having one person on the register. We may have a great, helpful experience on the floor but then wait forever to check out. It leaves me with a distaste for coming into the store because I cannot possibly plan my trip. The poor checker has to take the time to look up rewards, refer more products and remember to give us our free promotional items. I look around from the line I'm waiting in and see 2 associates applying make up (one on herself) and 2 other employee's stocking the shelfs. Not worth my time!</text>< Pics>

My experience was bad I went in there with my husband and child and the manager was looking at me all weird by the way did not open  another register, so we waited until other girl helped us and while me and my husband were there she said who's paying and I said my husband is and she said can you step back! only the person that's paying can be here. Poor customer service never returning to shop< /Text>

I called the store and asked if I order my things online can I pick them up in the store? No, but the clerk offered to get my items and have them ready for me when I came in. So I did that and it worked great. I've never had a problem with the sales staff. In fact, they've all been extremely helpful and polite. They are a unique group but it's to be expected, and I like the individuality of the staff, they're not phony or breathing down your back for a sale.<//Review>

I love Ulta but this location’s customer service is horrible! It’s more convenient to go to Ulta due to parking, but I’ve wondered around to see if anyone is available to help me and NOBODY ever asks, “Do you need help with anything?” Instead, they walk right beside me or don’t even acknowledge me. Last year, an employee was next to me talking to another employee aisles away about their drinking plans for that night while I’m waiting for them to pause so I can ask for help. Save yourself a headache and go to Sephora. They’ll treat you right there!< /Text>

I have the hardest time picking out lipstick. It was so nice today for Manessa to help me. Got her name off  the receipt. I asked her about a lipstick I was purchasing  and if i did not like it could I return she said sure. Then she said I recommend this lipstick DOC in Rose bud. I love it!!! There was a long line but she still took the time to help me out. Appreciate that Ulta has employee that try and know about the makeup. This is my go to place!!!< /Review>

Horrible customer service saw customers walk into the store and nobody was greeted (including myself). Two employees were in the front of the store talking to eachother instead of assisting customers who looked like they needed some help. The girls are the registers looked annoyed, no friendly smiles. Going into this store was pretty disappointing. I made a quick stop here before I got back on the road. I should have just dealt with on foot traffic at the mall and gone to Sephora.< /text>

It's hard trying to get help from the ladies. I was told they would have the item I was looking for the next day, so I went early in the morning the next day and when I asked a worker she didn't even look and just told me they were out. I just wanted to buy some foundation, but I will be going to Macy's or Sephora instead.< /Review>

Hate coming to this specific ulta! The employees are so rude every time I come here. I spent about 15 minutes trying to get someone to help and literally got close to two employees when they saw me they looked away avoiding to help me. Ulta In Santa Cruz’s Capitola mall  has the best customer service hands down.<//Text>

So I walked in knowing I wanted to buy a specific foundation, only problem was I needed to get matched. I asked an employee (I believe she was the supervisor or manager) if she could please match me or if someone else could, she said she couldn't and that she was closing and was on her way to turn off the music... told me there were sponges and I could do it myself. I responded "so much for customer service" and proceeded to help myself. A few minutes later I saw her helping someone else. I understand employees want to leave the store as soon as possible but customer service is an important key to keep customers to come back, and if you're busy helping others, you could at least be polite instead of rude. I will just stick to Sephora from now on.</Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>I haven't even been in yet, but I called on June 14 at 7pm  to make a hair appointment,  Mayra came highly recommended so i asked to be booked with her and the girl that picked the phone up took all my information down and said she put me in the schedule for Sunday at 4. I called Sunday an hour prior to my appointment only to be told that I was not in the system. So I had to rebook again with Mayra for the 30th of June. I had been warned already by my friend that this is a common thread for this store towards Mayras clients. Poor accountability and pettiness on the employees part and a waste of my time.< /text>< Response>

< Review>
I did a hair color and bought items the purchase was worth 330.00$ I went for a balayge and Mayra the girl who did my hair did put bleach but when she did toner it got darker instead of going lighter and my hair was already light my hair got so damaged she told me.to buy redcken products so I did but my hair she left it so damaged ut started falling apart I called multiple times and it was over holidays the management never answered or called me back when they finally did A manager named Jessica said I should have just used coconut oil if this was the case then why telling me to buy product long story short My hair was ling I had to shave it off now I look like a men I had to buy a wig I called costumer service they said they were going to reach the district manager but no one has called me this happen since November 29th 2016 and I did get charge in my Ulta Credit Card but I was to dispute this charge How can I do it  this is ridiculous< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Incredible, very nice the store but what a bad service they have, the young people who work there do not have a shred of kindness, they pass by your side they do not even deign to look at you, much less to ask if you need something, huh I think that's why they steal so much, because no employee is able to pay attention to anything, it seems that they are there by force not for the love of work, had the great intention of buying several things but so or the case I prefer to go elsewhere, ☹

(Original)
Increible, muy bonita la tienda pero que mal servicio tienen, las jovenes que trabajan alli no tienen ni una pizca de amabilidad, pasan por tu lado ni siquiera se dignan a mirarte, mucho menos a preguntar si necesitas algo, lastima creo que por eso les roban tanto, porque ningun empleado es capaz de poner atencion a nada, tal parece que estan alli a la fuerza no por amor al trabajo, tenia la gran intencion de comprar varias cositas pero asi ni al caso prefiero ir a otra parte, ☹<//Text>

<review>Caleb and his staff are very straightforward regarding the required repairs and cost determination.  Work is always performed in a timely manner and consistently we have returned to AWS for reliability.  Rental car discounts are available as well.  Clean shop and excellent service!< /review>< pics>

< review>
I brought my Honda in here and I felt that they were very, very efficient. They were able to do a full inspection, they gave me exactly what was wrong, what need to be fixed right away, what was optional, and after I signed off on everything, they went right to work and had it to me the very next day.

Very friendly people, very put together place, very clean, and I haven't had any problems with the car since their repair and maintenance.</review>

<review>I didn't speak with anyone else but Caleb was cordial, helpful and thorough with explanations and suggestions. I never felt pressured to make a decision one way or another. Instead, I was presented their findings and suggested solution matter of factly and he was also upfront with the cost. The cost quoted was exactly the same as the final cost too which is always a bonus! I feel I may actually be able to trust this shop! Going back for another vehicle next week!<//review>< user>

Just moved in from Oceanside and my bug eye WRX was acting up. Found this great shop online and they got me back on the road in no time. They have earned my business from this point on, you will not be disappointed.<//review>

They give you very detailed reports through a text that links to their website with pictures and explanations of what they find wrong. This is the only place that I will ever take my cars.

<text>My friend recommend AWS and specifically mentioned how great the owner Caleb was to work with. I was able to easily book my appointment online for the date and time I wanted. I knew I had an issue with one of my belts but asked that they do a full inspection while I had my car there. Once the inspection was completed they emailed me an incredibly detailed inspection report with supporting pictures. I then called Caleb to go over the report and discuss what services they recommended and why. AWS is friendly, affordable, and has great customer service. I will definitely be bringing my car back there in the future. Highly recommend!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>Been to AWS a few times for various repairs. Every time has been a great experience as far as auto shops go (cars take money to maintain that’s just how it is). The platform they use to communicate their inspection is awesome, I love being able to see what they looked at and what they found. They are honest about repairs which could be held off for a little and those which are more dire. Overall, I recommend them to anybody looking to get repairs or just routine maintenance. I rep them everywhere I go with a sticker on my car or my free hat I got last time.</text><username>Zachary Adkins< /username>< Date>

Not a honest shop. My receipt given had an over all total for parts and not a break down for each part. After doing my research I discovered that they over charged me close to $1000 in parts and that's not including the other $850 in labor fees.< /Text>

Very thorough and professional. I’ve been taking both of my cars to AWS for about a year now. Both vehicles are high in mileage and need a lot of TLC. These guys have been able to break everything down for me so efficiently and help me through the planning stages of repairs including priority to cost if that makes sense. He really really just wants to make sure things are done correctly and succinctly. Super friendly staff. People say they are more expensive but honestly I’d rather have honesty and pay a little more in labor for quality.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Just moved out here in the last 8-10 months and had to go through the process of finding another mechanic.

Struck gold coming here. Met Caleb and Mike, both treated me great.  Caleb is absolutely great, thorough, thoughtful and really goes above and beyond to help you.  Would call and keep me updated through the day, as well as took the vehicle out for a test drive to make sure the vehicle was properly fixed.

Was able to change the uppers and lowers for all four of my ball joints cheaper AND quicker then my other quotes. Work was done quickly and properly, no more "death wobble" while driving and I even saved a little bit of money.

Finding a trustworthy and quality mechanic is like finding gold. I have found mine here at AWS Automotive. Have you found yours?<//review><userid>101307349557531799874<//userid><username>Otto Weiler<//username><gmap_id>0x80e9ac5f6ccb22e9:0xc3b06be294cb0f38</gmap_id>< Time>

AWS exceeded my expectations servicing my 2000 f250 diesel truck.  On time service and was also impressed with their overall inspection of truck and recommendations for further service if needed.  Time was taken to take photos of tires, struts, temperatures taken from my AC etc.  Inspection report was sent to me via a link by text message.<//review>

<Text>What a warm friendly place of business.  Caleb is greets with a warm smile. He listens to your concerns and addresses each one fully.  This was my first time at the shop, so I was prepared to be over sold on what needed to be done on my car.  It was definitely not the case with Caleb.
I was very impressed when I received a text (and email) with a complete breakdown of my vehicle inspection,  including pictures of each part of the car that was inspected...which was the entire car.
My car was taken in for an oil change. The tires needed to be rotated, because the front were wearing out fasted than the back. He did at no additional cost. The only regret is that I did not bring my car to him years ago, when my friend first mentioned AWS.
This shop is a great model for what customer service should be at all places of business.

I went to AWS last week for the first time, and honestly, this place deserves 6 stars. This was the best auto shop experience I've ever had! First, Caleb, the owner and first person you meet when you walk in, is the kindest, most attentive, and most honest shop manager you could ever hope to run into. I ended up having to be there longer than expected due to some unforeseen issues with my car, and Caleb chatted me up, gave me a cup of coffee, and checked in with me several times to see how I was doing. During this time, I watched Caleb interact with several other customers and he was consistently patient, generous, and invested in the needs of his clients. He knows that, for many people, having a vehicle that runs well can mean the difference between functioning healthily and having your life fall apart.

The prices are reasonable and the work is thorough. I went in initially for an oil change and routine inspection service, and the technician found several issues, which I consented to being repaired on the spot. After completion, I was immediately emailed a very comprehensive inspection report with tons of details about the work and tests performed, and lots of before/after pictures. This was so helpful! Then, a few days later, I got an email from Caleb checking in to see how things were going. Everything was fine, he was just following up. This is beyond customer service, this is community service!

AWS Automotive is the only place I will take my car to get work done as long as I live here. It is evident that they view themselves as a part of the Ventura community and are incredibly responsible with how they run things as a result. It's places like this that make the entire town a better place!<//Text>

We have had some great mechanics in the past-- one in Madison, WI and one in Santa Barbara.  AWS definitely measures up!! These folks are courteous and patient; they go above and beyond to check things out; and, somehow, are reasonably priced as well. Not sure how they manage all of that, but they do!  Great service on both Subaru Outback and Camry Hybrid ;-)</Review>

All I can say is, "Wow!"

I have never experienced such straightforward, zero pressure, knowledgeable professionalism from an automotive shop in my life.

Caleb's expertise and polite manner helped guide us through what I know would have been an otherwise stressful situation with our aging car.

More so, their diagnostic method, where they send you an email or text (or both) of their entire inspection report, WITH pictures, is so handy I can't even begin to tell you.

This was my first time at AWS Automotive, and they have gained a customer for life.<//Text>

I love that all the repair and inspection come with a picture and a brief description of what was done, and what is recommended, THANK YOU!. Below is my one year ago post: This was the most amazing experience I had in my life, five star customer service, timely repair, and most important they did a great job on my 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan, fair prices, and they also offer you to create your own electronic account to make it easier to see your maintenance record.

<review>AWS was amazing!  There were some other issues that came up when the AWS team was working on my truck, and though I thought it going to be  inconvenient for me, the AWS team took care of me and made sure that I was all taken care of for those few days, while I was waiting for my car to be repaired!  They are a wonderful team!</review>< rating>

Their great customer service, knowledge and commitment to their clients combined with their online inspection report complete with photos, a loaner car and attention to keeping the customer informed creates a great auto service experience that cannot be beat.
I am in Ventura for a few months and needed service on my Ford F350 diesel, a very special vehicle to me as it had belonged to my dad. I selected AWS Automotive because of their great reviews. Caleb and his technicians performed the requested service and a vehicle inspection where they found one brake completely worn out, metal-on-metal. Their Vehicle Inspection Report was available to me online and included photos of all the critical inspection points and pictures that detailed the brake issue. This report is a great consumer protection tool that gave me great confidence in their credibility and dedication. Lucky for me they found this problem early on so they were able to machine my existing brake surfaces instead of replacing my brake rotors which would have cost considerably more. They completed this additional work with installation OEM spec brake pads. The extra work was finished quickly and at a very fair price within the price quote they had provided. Additionally, they provided me with a loaner vehicle while this work was being done.
I am familiar with auto mechanical issues and I am always concerned when I cannot use my normal shop for service. I also worry that when a shop gets my vehicle on a hoist, they may find problem and quote an inflated price to fix it as they already have the vehicle in shop. AWS Automotive and Caleb earned my total trust and appreciation with their professional, high tech, customer oriented service. I will always return to AWS Automotive for work when I am in the area and highly recommend them to others. I only wish this was my home town so I could use them all the time for my auto service needs.< /review><UserId.>100825893290008933917< /UserId.><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rate>5< /rate></record>

<review>My experience with AWS was great all around.  I needed a new alternator in my Sprinter van, which has been a difficult vehicle to find quality mechanics for.  These guys got me in the day following my call and were able to complete the repairs that same day.  They had a great price on the replacement part, as well as helped arrange an affordable rental car for the day, helping to minimize the inconvenience of having my van break down.  I dealt with Caleb, one of the owners and he was very helpful and professional.  This was my first time using AWS, but I wouldn't hesitate to go back for future service needs with the van.<//review><rating>5< /rating>< response>

Awesome service. Had to have my head gasket replaced, not a small repair. AWS took care of it. I love that they send you photos and a detailed break down of what is going on with your vehicle rather than a very basic break down that you'd typically get from a dealership. Awesome work I will definitely use them again.</review>

Came here to have the oxygen sensor replaced on my Impala. They also did a full inspection on my vehicle and sent me a detailed report of on potential problems and what to keep an eye on. They're not pushy here and don't try to upsell you. Caleb was very helpful when explaining the issue of the oxygen sensor and the steps they would take to replace it. I  highly recommend coming here for any issues you may have with your vehicle. Will definitely be returning again.</review>

I am never comfortable taking my car in for repairs but Caleb and Larry always make the experience easy and painless. I love receiving the email updates on my cars progress when it is in the shop and the text messages I receive after I pick up my car to make sure my experience was a good one.  The team at AWS is always very professional and I value their attention to detail and outstanding costumer service.

<Date>1563206175955< /Date><rating>5<//rating><Text>I found Caleb, Mike and AWS Automotive through Google and chose them based on the many great reviews for their shop.  My '06 Jeep Wranger had been leaking coolant for a few days and Caleb was able to get me an appointment with a quick turnaround of only a few days.

I dropped it off when they opened and the problem was identified and fixed by the time the shop closed that day.  They were even able to complete some other work that needed to be done outside of the immediate cooling system issue.  The inspection of the car and explanation of the issues observed were sent to me in a very clear emailed report with photos that was easy to understand.

Overall, AWS Automotive was super easy to work with, efficient with the work, and the staff super friendly and accommodating.  As a new-ish resident to Ventura, I am very happy to have found Caleb and his shop and will not only be using them going forward whenever I need work done on my Jeep, but I will be recommending them to anyone looking for reliable local shop that does good work.< /Text>< pictures>

AWS Automotive took Fantastic Care of my vehicle service needs and fully understood what was needed. Truly appreciated the professionalism and care from start to finish.

Thank you so much Caleb and your crew at AWS for excellent service on my little Smart Car and saving me money to boot.< /text>

My husband and I moved to Ventura last summer and, shortly after that, both of our cars needed various services.  My husband's is a Lexus SUV and mine is a Hyundai.  We both had a fair amount of work done on our cars and the results were nothing short of stellar!  Caleb and Chris were both very nice and very patient in explaining what was to be done, and we were given estimates which ended up being very close to the final cost.  Very recently, my husband's Lexus needed the transmission replaced (!) and we came back to AWS.  Again, absolutely fabulous work, and now Christopher's car is LIKE NEW.

Just this week (yes, I know, it sounds like a soap opera), the clutch on my Hyundai went out while I was at C Street.  AAA managed to get me going so I could drive to AWS, and it's now being fixed up and I will be picking it up tomorrow.  They talked to us throughout the whole process and I had the option of doing the bare minimum to get it running or fixing it up.  We chose to fix it up.  I trust that when I pick up my car tomorrow, it too will be LIKE NEW.

There is no way either of us would take our cars elsewhere.  Not only is the location convenient to our home, but we trust these guys and they haven't let us down.  I would refer anyone there, for any make of car, for any work.  AWS IS THE BEST!!!<//Review>

<gmap_id>0x80e9ac5f6ccb22e9:0xc3b06be294cb0f38<//gmap_id><Name>Rachel Garcia</Name><Text>When I first came to AWS, it was because my car's cooling system had a major problem.  I had already taken my car (an older Volvo sedan) to three other mechanics in the area (two of which were Volvo specialists), and even after two major repairs, no one could find a long-term solution to the problem.  My brother (a car freak) has been going to AWS for years and recommended I give them a try.  AWS thoroughly checked over my car, found the problems, and made the necessary repairs that ultimately fixed the issue with the cooling system.  I have kept AWS as my regular auto shop.  Every oil change, they have meticulously checked over the entire car, sent emailed photographs with descriptions depicting any located issues needing resolve, and have provided me with detailed explanations of maintenance needs along with various options depending on my financial restrictions at any given time.  It meant a lot that they would take the time to patiently answer any and all questions I had instead of hurrying me to make decisions or expecting me to simply take their recommendation at face value.  It's apparent that they value their customers' trust.  I'm moving out of state next week, and they took the time to methodically go over my car one last time, inspect everything and ensure it is road trip / winter weather safe, and humor my hyper-vigilant questions.  I will miss my favorite auto shop, and can only hope to find a place of similar caliber in my new home.  I highly recommend AWS Automotive to anyone.<//Text>< UserId.>

I have been taking my car to AWS for over a year now, and I have nothing but positive things to say regarding my overall experience with AWS. High quality customer service, extremely competent and professional, integrity, attention to every detail, friendly, and considerate. I feel very safe and trusting of the team and the level of quality work performed, which is very important in this regard. I HIGHLY recommend AWS for all vehicle needs.<//review>

< Review>
AWS recently did insurance work for me.  After interacting with Caleb, the appraiser told me that, out of the Santa Barbara and Ventura County areas that she serves, there are 2 shops that she feels really put the customer first.  One of those shops is AWS. I've been using AWS for years.  I can always get an appointment next day, and repairs are quickly completed.  I have never had unnecessary repairs suggested to me - absolutely no fails and everything is done right.  AWS completes the work for a fair price and gets me back on the road, ASAP. This is a really nice, well organized, clean shop, really exceptional.  But most important - the insurance appraiser is right.  AWS treats their customers like gold.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.<//Review>

Absolutely recommend this place to anyone. I took my 2011 Jeep Patriot to AWS after my regular mechanic was not able to diagnose and repair an issue I had with my alignment and suspension. The crew at AWS went through my car with a fine toothed comb and was able to identify multiple issues, and they sent me a full report with pictures of everything that needed to be done. I was talked through every action item and for the first time I felt as though someone really listened to me and cared to validate my issues and went above and beyond to ensure my problem was fixed. I'm happy to report that all my original issues have been resolved and the Car has never felt better driving it. Thank you AWS and I will be taking all my future car maintenance needs over to you.< /review>

Loaned me a car while repairs where made and somehow made it less painful. I recommend them highly. This was my first visit and will return from now on for all my vehicle's needs.

My experience at AWS Automotive was 5 star. Service was prompt and the owners, Caleb and Larry, were friendly and professional. I chose to wait for my car and the repair was completed in a more than timely manner. I would highly recommend AWS Automotive to my friends.</review>

I took in my 1966 International to find a mystery brake leak. They got me in same day due to a cancelation and diagnosed the problem in a few hours. Understanding it was a project truck, they graciously shared their findings and suggestions and allowed me to take it home and finish myself. They billed me very fairly and unflinchingly let my rust bucket into their shop. Really happy with the whole experience and they've easily become my new neighborhood shop.< /review>

Our family drove from New Mexico to see family in Ventura. The Ford Expedition (with 300,000 miles on it) started making some nasty noises when we pulled into town. I took it to AWS telling him that it was making a nasty noise. Larry took a look at it right away. He didn't hear the noise, but he noticed a pully wobble. He grabbed hold of the fan (engine turned off by now) and pulled on it. Some water dripped from the water pump. He said if I brought it in first thing next morning he would have it done in 4 hours. He carried through with his word, with an excellent report on my car. I would go back there without second thought. Great work AWS. Thank you.<//text>

For being someone who shops around and reads all the reviews before going to see a mechanic, I found AWS to work on my Prius.  I've been so satisfied with the quality of the work they do, I've been going back for the past 3 years and will continue to do so.

The guys are great, helpful, and very accommodating.< /text>

Dont normally post reviews, but I believe this place deserves it!! Upstanding facility. I've been to multiple dealerships around ventura county and I believe I have finally found the perfect place. Caleb is an awesome dude, I can tell when a business owner is passionate with what he does and actually cares about his customers. I explained the whole situation with my vehicle because ive been going to multiple shops trying to understand what was going on with my engine. We did a level 2 diagnostic and I was updated through text and email of what was going on with the vehicle. He was able to repair my vehicle (new ignition coils, level 2 diagnostic and brake fluid flush) within 24 hours, PLUS 3 year warranty with the new parts! My previous experiences from other places would have charge me at least a grand,  keep my car for multiple days with no pictures or updates. AWS really impressed me. In addition, the day I came to pick up my vehicle close to closing time, I saw Caleb treat his other customerS with respect and professionalism and was STILL able to help them. With that said, I believe AWS automotive not only focuses on doing their job, making sales or whatever, but they CARE about their customers, which is rare to find from a shop these days.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND this business!</Text>

AWS put a trailer hitch on my Mazda 2, an unusual ask but they were game for it!

They were fast, communicated very clearly and did an excellent job. They have a very nice staff, are honest about everything and i'm definitely going back for other servicing on my car.< /text>

<Review>I had never been to this business, but I read reviews and they were down the street from where I live.  I went in with concerns about noises I was hearing and feelings that something just wasn't right.

One of the things I LOVED about their work was they did a complete inspection and sent me pictures of what was wrong so I could physically see the issues instead of someone just telling me X is wrong with your car.

I had a LOT of things wrong that I didn't even know about that they were able to diagnose and the cost of repair was high, but worth it.  They prioritized the issues for me which was helpful (although I ended up getting everything done).  I drove the whole weekend after the repair with the radio off and the windows down so I could hear and feel how a good car runs.

As a single female it's difficult to find trades people who won't take advantage of you and are straight forward and can prove everything they're telling you.  I felt comfortable with them and will continue to return for all services my Camry needs.

Thank you Caleb and Larry.  You've earned a repeat customer.</Review><Time>1508295153444<//Time></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Just had my fifth visit to AWS this year. Have brought in 4 different family member's cars of different makes and ages. In every single case, Larry and his crew went over the cars with a fine-toothed comb and found some additional problems/maintenance requirements for each. Anything that was safety-related we took care of immediately. Since we were doing maintenance catch-up on several of the cars, the bills would have been too much to handle all at once and AWS said they will just keep track of these until we can do some cash-flow catch-up. Some of these items I was able to do myself and AWS just crossed these off the lists. They have sent two follow-up emails detailing items still outstanding on two of the cars. Every time I have dealt with them, they have been friendly, courteous and have taken whatever time I needed to fully explain what was needed to be done and what items I could defer for awhile. Pricing is competitive. Wish I had moved to Ventura sooner!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>AWS came very highly recommended by the family vehicle guru.  I was not dusappiinted at all.  They listened to me and took timexperiebcee to explain what "Dora the Exolorer" needed and worked with me to get the important items done, and let me know which items could be put off or done myself.  The best experience I've had with a repair shop.< /review><userid>107695216102886770882< /userid></record>

<text>To summarize, I paid AWS to fix an issue with my car (squeaking noise), which they did. About a week later the noise began again so I took it back. The owner, Larry, after insisting on wasting my time driving my car around to try to reproduce the noise, told me that he could not hear it and that he would not be able to fix it. About a week or two later the noise got worse, so I took it back again, having already paid for this exact problem to be repaired. He once again wasted my time driving around and ultimately said there was nothing he could do. Now, I know they say they're automobile specialists, but if the mechanic cant isolate a problem on an automobile by sight, then I think it's safe to assume he's no specialist. Suffice it to say I feel that they robbed me, no repair, no refund, and I took it to them three times for the same problem. I just wanted to warn any potential clients of theirs, they may or may not fix your car, but they will take and keep your money.<//text><username>Kelci Skinner<//username></record></dataset><record>

I came to AWS in a bind and I was very stressed out. They were amazing. They gave me the help I needed to get my car to pass emissions. They did not try to sell me things I didn't need. I will be coming back as a regular customer.<//Text>

<text>I have had my Trailblazer worked on by another company and after they installed 2 INCORRECT sensors for my type of vehicle and other major mistakes...I took my vehicle to Larry at AWS Automotive on the Avenue in Ventura.  I have never been anywhere else since!    I find Larry and his team to be very honest and trustworthy!  They gave me back the 2 incorrect parts and told me to go get my money back!  They will not try to sell you service or parts that you don't need!  In addition, they keep a very nice record of your service and follow up needs and will remind you via email of your up coming appointment!  This is particularly great because we are very busy and need our vehicle for our business!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AWS AUTO!  Lisa Price (Paws Like Us)<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>March 2015, Men's Journal Magazine published their issue voting Ventura, California THE #1 place to live in these United States. I believe businesses like AWS Automotive and it's outstanding friendly staff are  factors in what make Ventura a paradise like no place else. I purchased  97 Jeep about 5 years ago and it's had countless problems since the day I bought it. A few weeks ago a 4WD error code popped up and it couldn't of come at a worst time. I did some code readings and narrowed down the possibilities to save my self time and money. I went to 3 different shops before  finding AWS and they all gave me, what I call the  "run-a-round".  However As soon as I called AWS Automotive my worries were over!!!
From the time I scheduled my appointment to picking up my truck...I can honestly say Ive never been so pleased with the service of ANY business. The AWS team took down my error codes and quickly developed a game plan that suited my needs, my budget, and my schedule!  After finding a simple and affrodable solution the Owner himself, Larry,  called to update me. After a few hours  AWS  had me back on the road!  Larry is very hands on and you can  tell that he sincerely cares about his customers; Which is extremely refreshing when it comes to auto repair shops. IF YOU NEED ANY CAR REPAIR?! USE AWS AUTOMOTIVE!!!
Thanks again Larry and all AWS staff...you guys are much in the clutch!

Howdy! I recently took my Mercedes to AWS 5-9-12!  I shopped around looking for a new Machanic for two reasons.  I'm tired of being taken advantage by the local Mercedes dealerships mechanic and dishonest diagnosis. Did I mention I am a women too! I finally asked around and did my homework on-line.  In this case believe everything you read and hear.  I'm truly pleased with the prompt, diligent, and thorough service.  I had my front brakes, rotors, sensor, oil change( way over due) lower ball joint. Now my car rides PURRfect! The best part now if I have any problems or concerns regarding my vehicle someone is more than happy to answer my questions! Thank You AWS team!<//Text>

As a local business owner in Ventura (Realty ONE Group Summit) I understand the importance of customer service, professionalism, and ethics in business.  AWS Automotive personifies all of these traits and more.  They go above and beyond to be accommodating when scheduling around my busy schedule, will pick me up and drop me off at my office or provide a free loaner car for my needs while my car is being serviced, and are upfront and honest about the service they provide.  I take both of my cars to AWS and wouldn't even consider taking them anywhere else.  Finding a good mechanic is a difficult task, and finding a great mechanic like AWS is almost impossible.  Unlike other mechanics who try to upsell you, AWS tries to provide options to save money rather than charge me more for services that I may not even need.  They check in regularly not to get me to come back in so they make more money from me, but to genuinely check in to see how my cars are running.  I trust them completely and know that my cars are in good hands when I drop them off at AWS.

Thank you AWS for who you are and all that you do!

Check your repairs, don't just take their word for it.  If you are not careful they will overcharge you for even an oil change.  Nothing but a bunch of rip-off artists.  Too bad they don't know very much about cars, because all their knowledge is to take your money and leave you with a broken vehicle.< /Text>

I brought in my wife's minivan to have some work a month ago. We knew what was wrong since we had a mechanic friend who took a look but we wanted to see if AWS would try to upsell us or tell us something else. I was impressed that they confirmed what we already knew and simply worked hard to solve the problem and get us back up and running. They didn't try to upsell, bs, or anything else. They fixed our van at a great rate and with quick turnaround. I highly recommend AWS for anything you need.</text>

< Review>
I moved to California from New York City six months ago and I hadn't had a car in 12 years.  When I started shopping for one I fell in love with a '97 Range Rover and got a great deal on it.  As you probably know, Range Rovers are notoriously expensive to maintain and I am - by no stretch - the average Range Rover over, socio-economically speaking.  The first thing I did after purchasing the truck was take it into AWS (on a friend's recommendation) for a complete diagnostic.  I have never regretted that decision.  From day one the staff at AWS have worked with me to prioritize and schedule my necessary repairs over time, in a manner I could afford.  And being a bit of an ignoramus when it comes to all things automotive, I have never once felt condescended or taken advantage of by the team there.  To the contrary; Larry, Caleb and Chris are very knowledgable, highly informative and super friendly - even when answering questions that sounds like they came from a 5 year old.  They continue to impress me every time I take my Beast in there for anything, and I HIGHLY recommend them to all who read this.
Thanks, AWS!

<Name>P. Zacarias Castellanos< /Name><time>1525980960522</time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>(Translated by Google) They didn't fix the problem in my car. And pay approximately $ 800.00 dollars. I came back and they told me that they did fix it but that maybe it was another problem. The work they did to me was useless, which was certainly more expensive. Now I have to change the part that caused the problem on my own, because on their part there was no refund.

(Original)
No solucionaron el problema en mi carro. Y pague aproximadamente $800.00 dolares. Regrese y me dijieron que si lo solucionaron pero que a lo mejor era otro problema. De nada me sirvio el trabajo que me hicieron que por cierto mas caro me salio. Ahora tengo que cambiar la parte que me causaba el problema por mi cuenta, por que de parte de ellos no hubo ningun rembolso.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The trucks are in great condition!  The customer service was excellent.   4 stars because price could be more competitive.  But I will definitely be using this company again.</Review>

I have been renting trucks from this company for over 40 years.  They always have very good quality trucks that are kept up and running great.  They have nice lift gates on them.  Good customer service. I highly recommend them.<//Review>

We bought a 2009 freightliner m2 106 crew cab box truck
From Arizona, Justin Johnson is the person we delt with
Not being able to see it in person due to covid-19.He explained
The vehicle in detail going above and beyond, even after the sale
Always there to help my understanding of the Vehicle. CLASS ACT
if your needing a vehicle you will not go wrong with Justin and hisTeam.We cant Thank Them Enough< /Review>

I've been a happy customer for over 5 years. Excellent Service, Prices, and Trucks. I have rented their trucks without issues hundreds of times.

I even Purchases two of there Used trucks for my own company.  And now, I used Suppose U Drive to service my trucks.

5 Stars isn't enough.<//Review>

Had a last minute rental request and they hooked me up with a crew cab stake bed with 7x5 (ish) lift gate within 2 hours, to pick up industrial machinery from manufacturer. Friendly efficient folks, also allow for weekend key dropoff with a timestamp rather than making me pay full weekend rates. Will most likely ONLY rent from y'all in the future, so tired of getting taxed by other companies.

<review>The most professinal staff in this line of work. I got so aggregated from Budget rent a truck and rushed hete to get a truck.

Altpugh these guys only rent to commerce and business. They spend so much time with so I could find a suitable truck rental which I did.

I did not rent any truck but picked their mind up and happily provided to me. Thanks gat an A+ from me.

Budget should consider training their worthy emplyees- not all here.</review>< Pics>

I come here with my family and friends frequently, and for good reason; the place is great! The food, for starters is delicious, not the best I've ever had, but delicious for the price nonetheless. But the real reason that I love coming here is the service! The waiters and waitresses remember and greet you with open arms. This gives a homey feel that is hard to match in other places in the area. I only knock off a star because the food is slightly inconsistent in quality, such as the contents of their "Seafood Mix". In conclusion, if you want some good, cheap sushi and Thai food, and you are looking for a pleasant evening with friends and staff alike, come here.< /Text>

<Review>Wonderful! I came here for lunch during a work day and they were so accommodating to make me a gluten free roll and even had gluten free soy sauce. I was most impressed that the guy checking me out was attentive to mention he wasn’t going to give me the wasabi because they use a powder form that he was sure wasn’t gluten free. Thanks so much, and I’ll definitely be back!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x8083ff64283d3aab:0x278c940d94dac24d</GmapID></record>

This place is definitely not as good as the reviews.  If this weren't in Cloverdale it would be 2 stars.  The people are very nice, but that doesn't make the food any better..

The sushi is ok, good enough for when I have a craving.  I don't know what they think a 49er roll is though, check out any restaurant in the bay area, it's salmon and avocado with a thinly sliced lemon on top.  There are some weird Americanized rolls here, I've only had the classic maki and the spicy scallop hand roll.  I do appreciate that the california roll is made with real crab and that they don't use MSG.

The Asian food however is really bad.  The meats are low quality and spongy textured, not browned at all, and there isn't much flavor is anything I've had so far.  I've had the wonton soup, chow mein with pork, and tom kha with chicken.  The wonton soup was ok, dough was definitely on the thick and gluey side and it needed more broth/why are there pho noodles in it?  I think I just really wanted some Asian soup that day though.  The chow mein and tom kha were really disappointing, I wound up throwing away the remainder.  The tom kha was strange tasting, the best thing in it was the mushrooms and those were also low quality.  I wound up not eating the meat in either the noodle dish or tom kha.  Chow mein was bland, oily and the noodles were soft/gluey instead of chewy and slightly browned.

Bottom line is I'd order the sushi if I really wanted some sushi, but no matter the cravings I'm done trying things on the other section of their menu.</text>

<Resp>{'time': 1607847361225, 'text': 'Hi L Z,\nhope all is well.\nI am terribly sorry that you had an experience like this, and thank you for letting us know the problems, we truly appreciate your comments and suggestions!\nAs part of the front crew, I am glad you like our staff which means a lot for us since we all have to wear masks and it is hard to talk to everyone! As part of the kitchen crew, I am sorry that you had to throw away the food. I have some proposals for you and hope you could give us a try again, please!\nFor the won ton soup and 49er roll, we can definitely adjust by your preference since each soup is cook to order and each sushi roll is made to order.\nOur won ton is homemade and we found our won ton is at its best when the dough is thicker since everyone has to take their soup home! Plus we do not want you to get home and find your won ton dough and meat are separate as you are about to enjoy them! We tend to do low sodium because the soup is to-go style, and low sodium is healthier. If you would, please let us know that you want it more flavor or more veggies or even add more won ton.\nAs for 49 er, we have a roll that is salmon and avocado inside and tuna with tobiko on top; it is called Cherry Blossom Roll, maybe you would like this one better! And you are always welcome to customize your rolls, like add lemon slices or only orange tobiko, even add more tuna, anything!\nFor Tom Kha and Pork Chow Mein, I am very sorry that you had experiences like that and have to throw them away.

This restaurant is the one I always prefer. I eat in a lot of restaurants but to this place I keep coming back again and again. The crew is very cordial and the cooking they offer is so good. I would always prefer to have a nice dinner in this place. Highly recommended.< /review>

Sushi in Cloverdale! It's really good too! I stopped in for lunch and was immediately greeted by David. Super friendly waitstaff. For $9.99 I ordered the lunch special of two sushi rolls and a bowl of soup. Great deal! Neat little place on Cloverdale Blvd. Very good.<//Text>

A surprising find in Cloverdale, this sushi restaurant offers a great alternative to the other offerings in town. The lunch specials are reasonably priced and the quality is pretty good. Although not one of my top sushi restaurants in Sonoma county it's worth a try if you up this way.< /Text>

Not the prettiest place to eat, but the owner recently hired a sushi chef and built a full-blown sushi bar! My GF and I are regulars here and were blown away by the quality of the sushi. Any already consistently good restaurant has taken it up a notch with the addition of sushi. I've been waiting for 2 years to see sushi in Cloverdale, and Tian Yuen did not disappoint! Highly reccomend.</review>

If you want a design on your nails, want it done well, and want pleasant company, THIS IS THE PLACE! Ask for Natalie! This is the first time in a long time o got exactly what I went in a nail spa for.

As a bonus, sometimes nail technicians put on an abundance of cuticle oil and leave it for you to leave an oil trail on everything you touch for the rest of the day! BUT NATALIE MY GIRL wiped off access and treated me so kind!</Review>

My wife and I were here on vacation staying down the road. She wanted a pedicure so I came along. Best decision I’ve made in a while. It was great, the gals got us in right away as walk-Ins, she even gave our 2 year old a mini pedicure. Great place and great people!<//text>

These ladies were so amazing!!! In from out of town for a destination wedding and they accommodated a large wedding party (9+) on short notice, all with smiles and grace!!! Everyone is so pleased with their nails— the colors, the designs, all of it!
Thank you so much for being so sweet and for doing such a fantastic job!!< /Text>

The girl offered me a cold water when I sat down in the chair. The staff was the epitome of grace and elegance! The decor is serene and classy.

My nails were cut/filed crooked and gel manicure chipped after only 5 days. The lady also put 4 gel layers on one hand and 3 on the other. It was a disappointing experience.< /Text>

< Review>
I had my nails and eyelashes done here for my wedding and they did an outstanding job! Two women in my wedding party had never been to a nail salon and they loved it.<//Review>

A little messy, especially in the stationary isle.  But it’s understandable, the store is currently under staffed.

Pro tip: buy batteries at your own risk.  They seem to run out extremely quick in comparison to normal brand names.  I bought some AA for a flash light, it stopped working after a week (of light use).  Normal Duracell can last me 6 months with similar use.< /review>

I can literally spend hours in a dollar tree store & love their vast array of assorted nic-nacks. I do however try to not go unless I absolutely have or need to grab something last minute because I swear I go planning on only grabbing a couple of things & an hour or 2 later walk out w/2 bags full of stuff so definitely have a love & hate shopping dilemma to say the least.</Text>

<text>Receipt said Vinita, so I assuming she was the cashier. She has no customer service skills no hello, thank you.  Tossed my item down her dirty counter with everywhere. Crushed my greeting cards and made a face when I asked for another envelope.  Didn't offer to bag my item. Very unprofessional.</text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Very convenient doll store, not only have daily necessities, but also snacks and drinks to sell, travel bus down directly into the supply.

(Original)
很方便的dollar店，不光有日用品，还有零食和饮料卖，旅行大巴车下来直接进去补给。< /review>

I drove to the T-mobile Broadway branch to make my phone replace. When I got in, I saw 2 staff's just lazing on the at the back of the store, and you can see it in their eyes that they're pointing at each other to whomever should assist me. The guy stood up and greeted me. I told him my concern about my phone that it just suddenly stopped working. He just gave me a phone number to call without asking what's wrong with the phone. I wasted 3 days just to get a hold of assurant then they'll gonna end up transferring me to T-mobile since they're the one who's responsible for replacing my phone in the first place. It's a good thing that the same guy wasn't there on the day that I picked up my phone.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I asked her twice and she told me yes and I was okay with that and went on with the transaction but along the way I felt uncomfortable and received a bad service from this person. The reason why is because while she was taking care of the process she was on her personal phone text messaging. On top of that I tried to ask her some questions and since she was so busy on her phone she didn't pay attention to my questions regarding the two devices. The only reason why I went to that store is because my past experiences were greta but that sales representative made me not ever visit this store again. To make it worst one of the devices was delivered way past Christmas the reason I am not sure if they were both purchased same time and day and she said both would arrive the same day or next day before Christmas.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Time>1615330806189<//Time></record></dataset><record>

After being passed around to different employees I finally ended up with one that told me that my a SIM card is locked and the phone is trash that I need to throw away my phone in by a new one the other guy  kept telling him to call customer support with Samsung which he just wrote down the number and gave it to me and told me to call. This was the absolute worst customer service  that I had ever received from T-Mobile I will never go to  The t-mobile in Chula Vista mall ever again. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME COMING HERE.< /text>

Horrible customer service and wait time. Complaint sent to corporate store. Can't even get this location to answer business line. In store help was no help at all. Visit a Corp location at Plaza Bonita Mall for outstanding service. Avoid this store unless you have hours out of your day to waste.< /text>

I went exited to get a phone service with them, unfortunately they broke me down the fact that I payday for the phone I purchased and end getting a bill of $225. They eventually tell the payment was not done. But what they really did is stole from me. I recommend not to go to this store ever.</Text>

This Tmobile store was fast to find ways to make me pay more. Telling me what customer service said by phone was incorrect. Ended up leaving and making my transaction online... Flawlessly... Unbelivable how crappy t mobile storefronts are and how great their actuall service and phone customer service.</text>< time>

All they give you is estimates no actual pricing “about 250, about 22 a month” went in on Black Friday all they did was open our account we didn’t even walk out with a phone which was the most improbable thing.
Went the next day to get a complete different price from the night before, the store manager didn’t even bother to come back out and talk to us even though he had worked with us the night before.
So we closed our account and decided to go with At&t instead. Cheaper phones better service.
Horrible experience even though I’ve been a loyal customer I’ll never go back to Tmobile.

Again customer service sucks here man waste of almost 4 hours of my time.</text></record></dataset><record>

The store is spacious and with generally helpful staff.  Lately, I've been going a bit more often than usual because of the Note 7 recall and noticed that the music is constantly on a Dubstep-like genre.  Personally, I think the music could use a bit more variety.  Mad props to Rubio (I think that' his name. He worked 10-19-16 until closing time) he was incredibly helpful, much more so than I'm accustomed to with T-mobile staff from other stores (like the one on Palomar).  Anyways, thanks Rubio, your advice helped a lot.<//text><gmap_id>0x80d94de7af68f9ad:0x47f446ba82cc86b3< /gmap_id><user>114690568681169969492</user></record>

<Review>Not surprised by the low rating. I just waited 30 mins there while 4 employees stood around. The manager's excuse was some was training, one was "keeping track of time"...and she herself had just clocked in and was going over paperwork. If an customer was waiting for so long, you can go over paperwork later. There are SO MANY other tmoblies, do not waste ur time at this one. I am now at the one across the street. On top of that when I was asking where they were located in the mall the girl who answered the phone was very rude. Should have known. All they do is want sales and add one anyways. Trust me. Do not waste your time.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>SO Some what of the same review is on Yelp, but as more and more I'm picking details I'm noticing I have to add to the negative list. on here I'm giving one less star.

Ill start with the negatives so they are read, and i hope the staff from this Tmobile reads them:
1) a female staff welcomed us and I really didn't get the idea of her role in the store, she seem like she was playing the role of a hostess, she asked us and customers after what we needed help with and then lead us to a different rep. I don't get that. That purpose is not needed. Ask and help, don't lead customers to a different staff.
2) Another different female staff was asked by chris to help and put the screen protectors on our phones, i noticed she worked on my phone and left the screen protector with air bubbles, annoying! my only guess that it happened was due to her LONG FANCY NAILS!! thats more Annoying!!! a big fat NO! , it looks it made it difficult for her to work well on putting on the screen protectors. for me thats not professional in a work place, maybe at her wedding, birthday parties, night clubs etc or want look  cute for friends or guys BUT not for a work place!! so when i go back I hope to see the ladies with normal size finger nails!
3) I dislike when family or friends of emplyees come in an take the time away from their work, assuming a sister of employee came in with her kid to say hi, but that hi became more of a sit down and have a conversation. I was there for about 1.5 Hr and believe me that family or friend was there for the full time i was there, chitchatting with the employee.
4) this one I dont know if it was me who missunderstood or staff made it sound like a great deal on the package. So Phone cost 750 or so and later I will receive a pre paid card of 750 and all i need to pay is taxes, but at the end i ended up paying estimate of between 850- 900 for each phone, so the extras that were added screen protector, phone cases and memory card, I thought they were included in the package but after reading each paper put int he bag I notice thats the reason it went from 750 to between 850 and 900, that was more then the taxes.  so the extra items were just extra. Staff made it sound it was part of package and it was necessary to buy since "its part of the package deal" Ill check more into that.
5) New Detail: Just today a week after purchasing my new phones i am checking out the website for the Screen protectors item to check out the warranty, as I'm looking into details I notice the reason for the high price on the protector its because you are paying not only for the protector but also for the lil packet screen cleaner cloth, wet mini cloth and the perfect alignment tray with the roller thing. Well I had no idea of that, when staff was putting the screen protectors I did notice some fancy green tray but I had no idea it came in the box, after they installed the protector i notice they had put away the tray in their desk, i thought  it was theirs, never saw them taking the tray out of the boxes for me to say, "please return the tray to me" So now seen that I'm disappointed. I know some of you would think, why do u even want to keep the tray if is no longer in good use, well think about it this way, if you were paying some 800 dollars for items, you would want every single item included in that price.
6)relates to #2 on this list: so a week after I still have air bubbles on my screen, staff states they will go away in a few days. its been 8 days.

Second the Positives!
1) This location has more options on phones, so good BYE Hillcrest (Washington St)Tmobile, Now i have to drive 30min farther, BUT WORTH IT!
2) Staff really friendly and welcoming and energetic!
3)really clean location
4)  Chris was our guy and convince me to make a purchase, which i was there to get a NEW phone! Chris!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>I understand that it is black friday and that they made a waiting list, but the problem was that they prioritized people which is inefficient due to people waiting for hours only to see other customers who came in and just recently signed in to be given service. I had waited for atleast 2 hours to try and buy 3 galaxy s5 phones and get help since a family member of mine had her phone stolen.< /Review>< Name>

<Review>Tried to process a return on the final day (14 day return policy). I was refused service and asked to call customer service. Called while in the store, was told store should handle it. After 1 hour of insisting. I finally got the return processed by the store rep. unnecessary waste of time. Store is more concerned with revenue than customer service. Avoid store if possible!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

<Review>Horrible customer service.  Employee was using SnapChat and actually took a personal phone call while dealing with us at the same time.  We weren’t informed that the phone would need to be unlocked by the old carrier (which can take 72 hours).  So... we are now left without a phone for 3 days.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I wish I would have listened to the other reviews. What a colossal waste of time. At my first visit, they took 18 xrays. Then the doctor came in with an assistant and poked around in my mouth and dictated to the assistant. Then he explained to me his suggested "treatment plan", which included a "regular cleaning." Then the assistant left and came back with the $$, and I told her what part of the treatment plan I agreed to, then she scheduled me 2 weeks out and that was it. Done. No cleaning, nothing. I was out the door in 30 min., and they're were no other patients in the entire office. Needless to say, I canceled my appt. and won't ever be going back. It will be interesting to see what they charge my insurance for.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Called yesterday with an emergency they claimed twice in the same day "our computer (s) are broken. I had a friend call to test this claim, he asked for a appointment, same woman named Vanessa was ready to schedule him right quick and in a hurry. Right then n there I knew the truth, they lied to me, and I caught them red handed. I called back a few mins after my friend and said AGAIN 🖕🏻"I would like to schedule an appointment" then AGAIN 🖕🏻 Vanessa says "our computer (s) are broken I can't schedule you. So I told them I had a test call and caught them lying. She denied everything and I hung up. I am currently typing this from the Emergency Department because SAI dental REFUSED to help me. Will be reporting them to dental board of California shortly.</Text>

Sai Dental is wonderful! Every person who works there, from the dentist to the hygienist to the office manager is wonderful. They are friendly, professional, gentle on your mouth, do great work and are affordable. If you’re looking for a dentist, I highly recommend!< /review>

Everyone in the office is very helpful and professional from Claudia (front desk) to all the dental assistants.
The dentist explains his procedures and personal care needed later.
I would highly recommend Sai Dental Care.<//Review>

<review>Very professional work and incredibly nice staff.
We all dread going to the dentist, but since we HAVE to go, this is the place to go!
I had what I considered a dental emergency, and they were able to make room in their schedule to take a look at it within a couple hours of calling!!! And within 24 hours of calling and 2 visits the tooth was removed and the process was over with. I couldn't have asked for quicker or better service.
Also, being that I didn't have insurance, I found the prices to be very fair. I will definitely be going back to them (proactively, so that I don't need any more teeth removed!).
A Big thanks to the whole staff for taking care of me so quickly.<//review>< rating>

The staff is very nice and the Doctor has a gental touch. I have great oral hygiene so I only use Sai for routine cleanings.
Nothing major, but I have no dought that they could handle more complex work .
I would definitely recommend the team for anyone who does not have dental coverage, they have a very fair price for service.< /review><rating>5< /rating><Date>1556835214847<//Date></record>

It was like a symphony in my mouth!.. I usually have to take Ibuprofen before a teeth cleaning,(and then bare up under a lecture on top of it) especially after it being a few years since I've had my teeth cleaned.
The doctor and his assistant worked together in such symbiotic unison  and I barely felt a thing!
Who know dental work could be such a high end experience!
Same thing when I had a cavity filled!!!
They are definitely the best dentist team I have ever been to!! five stars 🎉⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<//Text>

So sue me: I'm terrified of "going to the dentist." But upon my first visit to Sai Dental all my worries disappeared. What a wonderful practice this is! Everyone was extremely kind, patient and highly professional, too. So very glad to have found them. I would recommend Sai Dental Care to absolutely anyone and everyone who needs an expert, compassionate dental practice in Sonoma.</review>

This restaurant is amazing with real homemade organic food. High quality, generous portions and reasonable prices. Very nice, kind hearted staff. Vegan options.
We wanted to order everything and almost did. The vegetarian lasagna melts in your mouth and the tomato sauce is heavenly. Perfect salads and chicken pot pie stew, not like the frozen supermarket kind. I had the Zucchini Imposter, was fabulous. Great soups and we are going back to eat the sweet and savory crepes. I highly recommend driving to this restaurant if you're near Mammoth Lakes CA.</Review>

We ordered Pumpkin Smash and Green Curry Eggplant, pictured below; and they were delicious. Lynn was cheerful and funny with statements like "You're smashed" and "Make a dent." Great restaurant and vibe, healthy plant-based menu.</text>

light taste, great healthy food.
If you want to take a rest with all those heavy flavor burgers and pizzas,
Make sure you try here before you leave!
You can have burgers or other fancy food elsewhere.
First bite is tasteless, but after a few more it just keep adding up and addictive.

tried the soup( bowl can be shared with 3-4 people without problems) and their special of the day.< /Text>

Relieved to find healthy vegan options while in Mammoth Lakes for a weekend trip. I got the sweet potato and brussel sprouts mash. It was very good but the portion size was a bit small. My (vegetarian) husband got the eggplant lasanga and liked it a lot as well.</Text>

My husband had the second salad  on the menu with blueberries and loved it. The atmosphere and the food were just right after a long draining day....the staff, two women were working  one of whom seemed new- both  were simply lovely, they radiated kindness with their genuine smiles and pulled me out of a major funk.

Two years ago, my hubby and I did the JMT and used Lynne’s dehydrated food for backpacking: DELICIOUS!!! (And lots of options for Gluten Free ...) 🥰

I hope Lynne is still offering great, backpacking food—because we are back at the JMT and practice hikes!< /review>

Makes me sad to see bad reviews on this place. This is not a place where you are going to find greasy, overly seasoned hyper palatable junk. If you can appreciate simple, clean foods and you want to feel AMAZING AND ENERGIZED after your meal,instead of sluggish and weak...go see this place for yourself. This food makes me feel replenished after a long day on the mountain and is ALWAYS a mandatory stop on my trip.<//text>< Pics>

It is advertised as a vegetarian/vegan , but you can get chicken and beef added to most dishes. When the town is busy and every restaurant is crowded you can be sure to be able to get a table here. Great, flavors and homemade dishes. I highly recommend Garden of Eatin.< /text>< userid>

Food wasn't cooked properly. We ordered turkey lasagna. When it was served, it was frozen. Waiter then took the food and microwaved it for sometime before bringing it back. Taste was bad, couldn't even finish this small size lasagna. Portion was smaller compared to cost. Can't recommend anyone.</text>

Really cute cafe and the staff was very friendly. This place has such potential and as a plant based eater I was so excited for the delicious sounding items on the menu, but the food was just underwhelming. The main dish (stew) was cold and lacking flavor and the hummus was a bit bland.<//Review>

<Text>Going out of my way  to leave an extremely negative review,which I normally never do.  We sat down and ordered four dishes.  One of our dishes was FULL of hair.  Two were fine, and the other one was not great.
After eating the two dishes we could eat, the server mixed up our credit card with another guest's.  We were charged for both meals.  We caught the mistake before we left and asked her to fix it.  She said she did.  We however were charged for both meals. When we called two days later, the person answering the phone gave US a hard time, and asked us to prove it with our bank even though we had both receipts saying we were charged twice. We were polite and did the work on our end by calling our bank and then she stopped responding.  We were clearly the ones wronged here and yet ... she's taking our money?!!!  Had to get the bank to reverse charges.  STAY AWAY. REALLY bad establishment<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80960c30522aacc1:0x928c57e20bda6a19<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>Quite overpriced for overcooked and close to burnt food. Also pretty slow. What could have been done in about 45 minutes took close to 2 hrs. Not sure why we wasted perfectly good outdoors' time in there.

Another minor thing, they wouldn't be willing to split the bill in seprate checks. Not a big deal but then shouldn't expect those kinds of conveniences if they cant be considerate to their customers' time

Make your own decision when choosing where to eat.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Service was not great and very slow. We were hardly greeted to start. The slowness wouldn't have bothered me any if it hadn't been for the fact that other people were coming in after us being served, eating and paying all before we ever got our meal. When we did get our meal the order was messed up. They did fix it but were less than apologetic about the entire situation. The food was good not great. Very small portions for the price.</Text>

I think some of the negative reviews were because some people confuse this place with a fast food restaurant. It took awhile, but no longer than expected if you expect the food to be cooked and not just microwaved.< /Text>< Pics>

Their chicken pot pie is not a chicken pot pie.  It's a bowl of runny soup with two pieces of bread placed on top.  Also their smoothies we're very runny, more liked an iced drink.< /Text>

I ordered the tri tip sandwich with greens, tomato and spicy mayo. The bread was soggy and there was so much spicy mayo it was hard to eat. The meat was green, tough, and non-edible. I attempted to take a bite then split it out and threw it away. When I asked where the bathroom was the owner of the restaurant gave me a rude smurk and said " oh are you seriously ask I asking me that dear?" And pointed to what I thought was a closet with a picture of a bird on it like I'm supposed to know that was a bathroom. If you want to be highly disappointed I love rotten food go to garden of eaten.<//text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I went in around mid day to get take out. I looked online beforehand and saw that their prices were okay for what it was on the menu, so I decided to go in. I went in and first thing I noticed is that the menu on the website isn’t accurate. The prices are higher in the restaurant than they are shown online, on average a $2 difference. Since I already came in, I decided to just go ahead and order it anyways. I got the Zuccini Imposter and the Climax smoothie. I was told the order would take 15-20 minutes. The order ended up taking almost 40 minutes. The total ended up around $21, just for myself to eat. After getting the food, the box started leaking through the bottom of the container and leaked into the bag. I tried the smoothie first. It was said to be a peanut butter chocolate smoothie, but honestly only tasted like watery almond milk with a faint taste of peanut butter. As well as this, there was all the peanut butter on the bottom of the cup, in chunks. Then I tried the zucchini dish. Although described on the menu as vegan, which I needed because I am allergic to dairy, it came with a side of cheese, uncovered. The side of cheese spilled into the dish so I couldn’t eat half the dish. I was really upset because cheese wasn’t even listed on the menu and the price is pretty expensive for what you get. Understandably, I should have checked before leaving, but because of the price and the fact that the menu didn’t mention ANY cheese, I didn’t feel the need to check. For the price and the constant issues here, I wouldn’t go back.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80960c30522aacc1:0x928c57e20bda6a19</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1541792178077</Time><Response>None<//Response><Review>Do you want to enjoy heated up frozen food while receiving rude attitude from the owner/server? If yes, then this is the right place for you.

During our visit to Mammoth Lakes, we dined at this small local restaurant for lunch. We went there after a long hike at a nearby trail and kids in our group were very hungry. So one of the kids mom bought a subway sub for her son on our way while we were looking for a place to have lunch. We chose this restaurant in an attempt to support local eateries instead of chains. However, the server lady was super rude when she saw the mom trying to feed the sub to her starving son. Instead of telling us the store policy with outside food, she straight up told our whole group of 12 to leave. We stayed calm and didn't want to make a scene. So the kid's mom went back to her car with her 3 yo son to feed her starving son. Rest of us stayed at that restaurant to have lunch which we later found heated up from frozen and not freshly cooked. Our turkey lasagna was half frozen when served and when we mader the server aware of it, she took it back to microwave it again. She was blaming her microwave didnt work properly first time. So careless after being rude. What an experience!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Almost, but... I agree about the portions being small and sandwich is advertised as coming with fruit and chips but only received chips. I had the eggplant sandwich which was ok. Service was friendly but the atmosphere... Music too loud and kind of irritating. I wanted to like this place but I didn't. Giving it 3 starts because the food was ok and the service was so friendly.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Did that really happen? No Service Dogs allowed...I was told by the owner to remove my service dog (who was wearing her service vest and partnering me) from the edge of their catering tent. She was adamant that I leave the perimeter of the tent, while I told her I needed one minute. Her greatest concern was for the safety of the food as opposed to my health. I'm well aware of and respect Serve Safe food handling and critical points of contact. Fortunately for the owner, my need was not critical, but because I was unable to attend my needs, I did require service from my dog and friends. But what if my need for refuge had been to control an epileptic seizure or if I was a diabetic and requiring insulin, then what? The owner's behavior was unsympathetic, offensive, unapologetic.< /Review>

1. The door did not close properly, we had to close it several times. It is not fun on the windy winter day.
2. We ordered a yellow curry plate with tri tip. They never said they were out of tri tip, brought the yellow curry, said sorry the tri tip is not ready, we waited a bit for that. The curry got cold. When we ask for the check we were told they were out of tri tip. Not fun for a hungry man. Very disappointed. Did not have that kind of service ever.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) The place is very chill out and food is great and the price is very reasonable. Has many tasty vegetarian food and many dishes are uniq and creative. The owner made her special tomato sauce for us which is 100 times better than the catchup for a plastic Bottle:) If you want to eat a special lunch that is lighter in the United States, it is very recommended. The dish is delicious and very creative. It is not cheese and burger. I recommend eggplant lasagna. The sauce here is the real tomato sauce made by the owner is not a simple catchup!

Bomb! Wish I could have taken a picture but I devoured it immediately. I had the Chicken Udon and I loved it. A little sweet and just the perfect amount of spice. The portion was large enough to share or save some for another meal. Definitely coming back!< /review>

I just happened to be in the area and thought I would check out this place.

There is street parking or parking in the back. From the moment I walked into the restaurant, service was amazing. The cashier was really welcoming, attentive and helpful in explaining the menu since I have never been there before. I eventually picked an item from the lunch special which was two cheesy tacos for $5.

Wait time was extremely short. I also came by just before the lunch rush which might have helped. When my food was ready, she laid it out for me with great attention to detail. I was definitely not expecting that and she went above and beyond.

The food itself was okay. I felt the soft taco shell made of cheese was super salty, rubbery and almost burnt. The tacos were dripping in oil.

The decor mostly consisted of mostly animal wall decals with youthful and uplifting messages. There was only one bathroom and it was nice and clean.

I gave this place four stars because my food wasn’t spectacular. However, the service was excellent and waiting time was minimal. I plan on coming back to try something else on the menu.< /Text>

if you havent been here youre seriously missing out!!!!!!! Thai and Mexican fusion in the most delicious way!!
I got the curry burrito (with tofu, vegetarian style) my friends got al pastor burritos. Absolutely incredible!! Fresh, flavorful, perfect spice level, and a variety of flavors and textures.

We also got fried pickles. I had like 3 which were incredible, but ended up commiting to just the burrito; it was just that damn good. I had to devour it right then and there.
We also got a mango sparkle (like sparkling water and mango juice? I couldnt tell what was in it but it was light, sweet, and a perfect complement!)

One of my friends got horchata, and the other got a berry smoothie with boba
everything everyone got was a hit!!< /review>

<review>Sometimes I think it’s a bad idea to search for food when you’re really hungry because not only are you super impressionable but everything starts looking fire. Haha. I spotted this location on the local section of Google Maps and saw a pretty sick review saying that I NEEDED to give it a shot. Naturally, before getting hangry, I did. I’m so happy to note that this location is far too good a deal cost-wise but as I’m sure we are all well aware now... you get what you pay for nowadays. Some people probably are thinking 3 stars is a bad review but I think otherwise. I think that this location is as average as it gets. Low prices, descent food, and open during COVID. You can’t really go wrong. I’d say give it a shot too but don’t go open-minded. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend any item specifically as the items I ordered won’t be ordered again on my end. Good luck!< /review><pics>None<//pics><userid>103097072824624506718< /userid><name>David May<//name>< Gmap_id>

<text>Do not recommend this place.I ordered their Pad Thai and it didn't even come with Pad Thai Sauce.Might as well call it fried rice noodles.And I've also tried their shrimp fried rice and they scorched the rice and the shrimp was undercooked.And when I went to ask for an exchange for something else the store owner was very rude and gave me a refund and did not offer to make something else. Needless to say will not be going back there.< /text><rating>1< /rating>< Pics>

I have been searching for tasty carne asada fries for the longest time and Pika Rico did not disappoint! I got a really great serving size and all the right toppings to make the fries delicious. This place has so many options, from pad thai to burritos! Very friendly service, good food, and fair prices.</Text>

A staple in the Mexican/Thai fusion genre. I recommend trying everything on their menu if you can, but my top recommendations are:

1) Taco Sampler - get about 5 or 6 different tacos which are all incredibly tasty. Reasonable pricing.

2) Mexican Fried Rice - I find myself ordering this most frequently. An excellent blend of two classic rice dishes.

3) Spicy chicken burrito - it's a chicken burrito that is spicy, enough said.

4) Crab Rangoon - perfect way to end your meal. Sweet and savory.

5) If you like Tom Yum, then definitely get the Tom yum burrito and/nachos.<//Review>

Look.  It is not your fancy pants place or location, but if you want to eat good tai food, or good mex food, this place is it. I came in and ordered the 7 marea Tom Yum soup, I was happy with the order and the service.  Food was good. The drink was good. I enjoyed it. I didn’t know what to expect but I’ll definitely be ordering to carry out,  lots of Grubhub orders were coming through.

Will be coming back.<//Review>

<text>Oh, wow.  Where is the six star button?  This is the kind of delightful discovery that makes me wish I was a food writer.

This little hole in the wall has the most exciting fusion flavors I've met in Los Angeles, and it's inexpensive to boot.  Lots of good options for vegetarians and carnivores alike.  Our $25 meal left us full and happy with lots of leftovers!

The included Thai chili chips and salsa may have been the highlight, but we loved the fried pickles, mango fried rice, and tofu curry burrito as well. We will be back!

Plentiful parking in the back, too! Nice bonus.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c29703e2c01783:0xdfd2584664518e89</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

WOW, just WOW! I ordered the 6 tacos sampler & they were amazing. Love that they have Sticky Rice w/Mango. I can't wait to try different items. The Asian/Mexican fusion is very well put together at this place and will easily become anyones go to spot for traditional dishes with a unique twist. Beef Teriyaki  street Tacos are my new favorite.< /Review>

Love this place! Mexican/Thai fusion.  The ceviche is excellent & you get a lot!  They serve tortilla chips with a lemongrass salsa while you wait.  Yum!< /text>

The curry chicken burrito was excellent, as well as the Cranberry Crab Rangoon. The inside is adorable, and is decorated with cute, mindful phrases. I highly recommend giving it a try even though the neighborhood is bordering on questionable.</Review>< Pics>

I went to order some food and there was this skinny female cashier that was super rude. Not only that but after I ordered my food and got it, the specialized items I requested weren't even there. 1 person ruined it all for me and I am NEVER going back. They need to train their employees the act of CUSTOMER SERVICE and if you don't like your job give it to someone else. Good riddance!<//Review>

<Text>Never EVER in my right mind I'll be back there! When looking at the menu my first thought was that it was very expensive. You don't think that a small business like that would have those prices but well, I was hoping that the flavor of a small entree would be worth the price. My daughter loves orange chicken (it comes with about a cup of an insipid  white rice) and I bought that, which by the way is their cheapest item  ($7.99 plus taxes I ended up paying  $9.98). We came home and surprise!  It was  the most terrible imitation of a delicious oriental meal, there were  breaded tiny pieces of an over fried chicken, very oily, no flavor whatsoever and a horrible presentation, with some red and green bell pepper slices and the typical sweet orange sauce. My kid ate it because she was extremely hungry after her long day at school, but hey, I felt guilty for letting her eat that thing. No, not trying to be mean but if you want to spend your hardly earned dollars go somewhere else, WHEREVER! Go to panda express and get a delicious 2 items combo with rice/noodles for about  $8 including taxes. Morale: never eat a thing from Picka Rico.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c29703e2c01783:0xdfd2584664518e89</gmap_id>< username>

Love this place. Everytime I'm in the area this is the must eat place for me. I usually get the Chicken Fajita Chow Mein which I highly recommend as it's the perfect fusion of food. Their tacos are also very delicious. The staff is super friendly. Great spot!</Review>

<Review>This place is a little hole in the wall but such a unique eating experience! Essentially everything has a hint of spice and tom yum. The food was very tasty and the prices are wallet friendly. My table got the mexican fried rice, pad thai tacos, and beef tongue ones. I have no complaints! If I were to go again, I'd recommend the taco sampler as the tacos are smaller but you get to try all the flavors. I also got the horchata which was mediocre but went nicely with the food.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I was so excited to try this place due to the great reviews, but unfortunately my experience was terrible. I think I might have come on a bad day because there was only one person cooking and around 10 customers. I ordered the carne asada plate and taco plate to go and ended up waiting more than 30 minutes for the food. That didnt bother me so much because like I mentioned, I only saw one chef cooking behind the counter. Once I got home and started eating the food though I realized that the meat was undercooked and it was so thick that I couldn’t even manage to cut it so I couldnt eat it at all.
Was very disappointed in this place but maybe I can give it another try later it since they do have a variety of options, they just need more help.< /text>< Pictures>

Ever had a thai curry burrito, or a pad thai taco?I was surprised by how well the flavors of these cuisines melt together. Expect a bottle of tapatio next to siracha at your table. Warm up with tortilla chips covered in a sweet and spicy curry sauce. Thirsty? How about a thai iced tea or perhaps a horchata?
Dont be afraid, it's all delicious.<//text>

When I think about great food fusions Mexican-Thai does not come to mind. I've never fathomed chicken curry quesadilla, but somehow Picka Rico has successfully captured the best of both worlds.

If chicken curry quesadillas are a bit too adventurous for your palate you can chose to partake in either Mexican or Thai delights solely. They have a large selection of strictly Mexican food choices such as taquitos, tacos and nachos and they also have strictly Thai delights such as Pad Thai, "Pad See You" and an assortment of tastily described fried rice.

My first encounter led me to the Pad See You which was utterly delicious. It was well portioned and packed with tons of flavor. Above all else, it was reasonably priced.

The second time I came here I wanted to be a bit more adventurous and got the tacos with the chicken curry quesadillas. The regular chicken tacos were decent but I would suggest going for the spicy chicken. The spicy chicken contains a lot more flavor and the spice level is only at a medium. BUT oMGahhhhh the chicken curry quesadillas were the money shot! Such a great blend of Thai and Mexican piquancy! It's ooey gooey goodness with every bite and a must-try!

Service is excellent, parking is ample in the rear and the prices are pretty reasonable.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The flavor is good but the portion of what they serve you is very small for the price they charge.

<review>We recently moved back to the area and were excited to check out this place due to recommendations and proximity. Despite a short wait time and friendly staff, the overall experience was a bust due to the bland and very over priced food. They also seem very relaxed about COVID guidelines and I'll leave that up to the reader's interpretation.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Great atmosphere, great menu... I think I caught the chef on an off day. I ordered the salmon and it was overcooked and dried out. It came with what I think was supposed to be a lemon butter sauce but the salmon was covered in cracked pepper which drowned out any other seasoning/flavoring.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd2ca4c04e977f:0xd4ceb037c83663a4</Gmap_id></record>

I love this place!  Excellent service!!!   (Thank you Jeannette) We sat in the bar area. I had a martini. Asked for blue cheese stuffed olives(which they don't carry) they HAND STUFFED olives for us!  Shocking service.  Love it! The way customer service should be.
The food is equally amazing.  Great place.
So good even Carol Burnett thinks so!!!'< /review>

I arrive at this outstanding restaurant once a month since I like the ambiance that is unique to this place. The crew is awfuly loyal and experienced. The service is exceptionally quick. Most important, the food they serve is excellent. I visited more than once and I was always delighted. The expense is fair. I highly recommend this place to to everybody.< /Review>

We met with friends at this place for a meeting. This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, we were not disappointed. The staff members were very polite and we felt good. The meal was fresh and delicious. We had a great time and we shall definitely come back again. Recommended.< /review>

From the moment  you step in this place  the waiters give you an excellent feeling. Very congenial hosts, it is a lovely restaurant to hang out with buddies or with your date. heavenly  cuisine, talented  chief cook and stuff, honest  cost and excellent  service. Warmly recommended.< /review>

If your in LA Mirada this is a romantic venue with well perpared steaks, chicken, lamb, and seafood.  Great for special occasions and hopefully will have indoor dining soon.< /review>

Have eaten there twice before pandemic eventhough it is 2 min away from me , keep forgetting it. I tried twice during pandemic to eat local to encourage business . I order curbside since we don't have delivery services in malibu. Twice I asked if I can have curbside pick up. Denied twice . I thought by end of pandemic they would have learned to take credit card by phone ...no way I would go inside that tiny restaurant to pick up food. You get 3 stars for providing average food in past and zero for lack of respect to your neighbors . Went to another restaurant tonight that accepts curbside . To my bad luck they made me wait an hour. Can't win in malibu .hope you stay in business .< /Review>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Just got off the plane and was hungry for breakfast. Ended up at Mr. V's Bar and Grill and it was delicious! Large portions and everything was fresh. This is a must stop if ever in Glendale. Only downside was the parking. It was a Saturday so it was understandably busy, but some patrons were in a rush and in that parking lot you can't be.</Text>< pictures>

I no sooner leave Mr. V's before I'm thinking of when I can come back for the great food. If you didn't have their aromatic shrimp or dessert with your meal, you missed out!<//Text>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>A dark cozy steak house with amazing food and classy service. But you can go in jeans and a hoodie if you like, it's not pretentious. Prices are quite high but great quality. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the only option is valet parking; the guy took my keys and parked the car 10 feet away, I could have done that myself! Carry cash to tip the valet guy.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbLIPA6NX4k2Nhf8-pliBWLmwjRvwbb9oRG4Dy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

<Review>Was really disappointed with the prime rib. It was salty and very lean, like a ham. Definitely not a Certified Prime grade piece of meat as their menu would have you believe. There was hardly any juice either, like the meat was previously cooked and reheated. I'm never going to get steak here again.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dd2ca4c04e977f:0xd4ceb037c83663a4<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Upscale, delicious, and a good bar selection make Mr. V's a must visit if you're in the area.

Friendly staff, fresh ingredients, and varied menu will keep you coming back.</Text>

My first time at this restaurant and I simply LOVED it and was a perfect evening. The ambiance, the food very delicious and the excellent service by all! I was there with my family of 11 and they provided the best experience and made us feel like their family. We will definitely come back to this restaurant!  Very attentive and delicious food overall!!!!</Review>

This restaurant is  great ! The decor is very classy,  they  played soft jazz throughout  my dinning experience. The food was awesome the bacon wrapped  scallops  were cooked perfectly.  My shrimp skewers  were fantastic. The lobster tail was awesome. I can't  stop asking  myself  why it took 4 years to finally check this restaurant  out.. they're  wait staff is great, and very attentive. If you go you will not be disappointed..</Review>

My parents have been going here for years and always rave about the food and staff. When they showed it to me once, as we were driving by, I wasn't impressed because it's located in a strip mall. For my mom's birthday this year she wanted to go to Mr. V's so I finally went and wow... Mr. V's is top notch! Highly recommended!!!</review>

This restaurant was the best I had in a very long time.  The service was impeccable, as it was my first time there the server suggested an excellent choice from the menu.  I was in heaven!! I do have to say somewhat pricy but worth every penny you spend. I can't stop thinking about my meal and how delicious it was.< /review>

This is a very nice place.  Had seen it each time I was on Valley View, but had never gone in.  Had the mahi mahi it was excellent.  Good place for a celebration.  Our waiter was very personable, our party had a good time.  Parking is limited, I suggest valet parking, no charge, did tip the valet.<//Review>

<Review>Mr. V's is a diamond in the rough.   I Love their food.   The ambience is very romantic.   Very classy as well.   Perfect place to go on a date.   Candlelight and flowers on the tables.   Love it!  The staff is always very attentive and genuinely concerned that everything is perfect.   They also have a bar that is always cozy and inviting.< /Review>< Pics>

Food is still pretty good here, but it used to be a lot better. Be warned! The cooks overcook meat here. so if you want medium better ask for medium rare and if you want medium rare you better ask for rare.</Review>

Was visiting from out of the state and wanted to have a nice steak dinner. Checked out other reviews and decided to check this place out. Everything was great! Service, food, and the vibe of the restaurant. Would definitely come back if I'm visiting again</Text>

We Live Mr V's. We had Brent B. Serving my husband and I.  Such an awesome person. Knew about the menu and so friendly
As a matter of fact all the workers there were always aware of the guests of what they needed. Mr. V, you have great food.
Thank you.< /review>

<Time>1517725683397< /Time><Text>Every single time I have dined at Mr. V's has been a wonderful experience. Tonight having dinner and drinks there with girlfriends was extra special.  We arrived a little early for our 6 pm reservation but we were seated right away and immediately discovered our favorite waiter, Brent, would be taking care of us (which he does so well).  His service is suberb and the food we ordered was perfection as always, so delicious!!  We girls had such a great time. We absolutely love Mr. V's and plan to dine there as often as possible in the future.  Mr. V personally greeted us and welcomed us while there. We enjoyed that as well. What an incredible restaurant/bar Mr. V's is.</Text></record>

<text>This is our usual place when we want to celebrate something. Even though it was lunch, we got the 'ok' to order prime rib (no baked potato before 4pm). The bread & food was good as usual (especially the crab cakes!). Service was a lacking but maybe because it was weekday lunch?< /text>< pictures>

Old fashioned steak house.  The Petite sirloin is my favorite.  Make a reservation and come hungry.  Great wine selection. Perfect place for a romantic anniversary dinner.  Mature crowd. Not kid friendly.  The manager stops by your table just to make sure everything is wonderful.  Thick juicy steaks, pastas, great appetizers.  Real comfort food $$<//Review>

Only once did they screw up on me but they made up for it. They served me a 12 oz instead of a 18 oz steak. I told the waitress so the manager came out and he gave me a 18 oz to go... i wasn't mad :-) i love this place, i try to go often! Anyway, the food is good here and so are the mixed drinks. Never been disappointed once, awesome service. Love the steaks and aromatic shrimp. The place itself is clean and tidy! 👍🏼< /Review>

<review>Mr.V's is the place you would go to get a better meal, better experience , better service better ambiance.    . I usually ask for a martini olives on the side. They have big martini glasses. Martinis are topped off.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Last night our Family celebrated our Mothers' 85th birthday.
The service, food and ambiance is excellent!  We had a party of 15.  Everyone was satisfied with their dinner orders.  From the moment you walk in their staff made you feel welcomed.  Our servers Brent and Melissa.... what a team!
Thank you Mr. V's and Rudy for making our evening a night to remember.  My Mom is still talking about it today!  We will absolutely book our dinner celebrations here again!</Text>< Pics>

My husband and I discovered Mr. V's on our way to North Woods Inn.  On a whim, we had to give it a try (since our last name is V).  Without a reservation, the wait on a Friday night was an hour, but we were able to find a spot in the bar where we were able to get full service.  The live music was an amazing saxophonist.  The food was delicious and reasonably priced.  We enjoyed a couple Mediterranean dishes that were perfectly seasoned and prepared.  Our waitress, and all wait staff we encountered, we friendly, cordial and attentive to our needs.  The restaurant offers complimentary valet parking, and it's highly suggested that you use the service since open spots are hard to find.  Overall, a great place I highly recommend.< /Text>

<Text>This restaurant is the way restaurants are supposed to be.  High-back booths, waiters that dress and act the part. Presentations that are off the hook. Delicious cuisine made just the way you want it.
I was so impressed with Mr. V's, I've made a mental note to go back there the next time I'm in town.<//Text>< Pictures>

The very, very, BEST restaurant. It NEVER disappoints... And our server Brett (I believe that was his name), was 10 stars. We always look forward to also seeing & talking with Milo, who always welcome's us and everyone and adds that extra special touch for making everyone feel important! Love this place, and the food is always 10 stars as well.Peggee & Joe Marcano<//review>

Went because we got a giftcard from friends. Was a good time,  nice place,  over priced,  same quality available in the neighborhood for much less $$$. Likely not to return. Staff nice, polite,  very noisy and cramped.</Review>

It's terrible. Service is poor. Will not come back for the over priced steak. Seems like a place for nice plating but horrible food. Go to sizzler for a cheaper and better steak for comparison<//Review>

<text>I will return to dine here again. Service is excellent. Both the presentation of the food and the flavor is very good. However, it is slightly on the salty side. I can't remember the exact name of the dishes we ordered, so I won't try to say them here in case I get it wrong. So, more reviews to come after my second visit, and I will have more details.</text>< name>

I give it 3 stars because sometimes the food is 5 star great and sometimes it is one star horribly inedible. I would like to know which nights the real chef works since we live just around the corner and love fine dining.< /text>

<Review>The most impressive part of my experience here was how versatile the staff is, including our waitress, the bar tenders and the kitchen. Our alcohol orders included wine, bourbon and a lemon drop. All three were made with excellent attention to detail. Our food orders included chicken marsala, filet, sefood pasta, a shrimp appetizer and crab cakes. Since this is not an Italian restaurant, I expected the marsala to be mediocre...it was INCREDIBLE! As for the crab cakes, I do not typically indulge in crab cakes, but I couldn't say no, when it tasted so good to say yes :-) I will definitely try to come back here, next time I'm in the area!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Pricey, but worth it. Been here several times and I've enjoyed myself everytime. I get the Rib-eye most of the time but I have gotten other items like the stuffed Salmon as well. Steaks are consistently cooked very well (I get mine med rare) so I tend to gravitate towards this particular meal. Parking is practically non-existent but free valet is available...bring cash to tip the valet.< /Text>

One of the very best restaurants anywhere around in the greater Whittier/La Mirada/Norwalk area. Mr. V's is old school at it's finest. The service is superb and the food is absolutely outstanding. One thing I like is that you can hear yourself think as the background chatter is kept to a minimum due to the decor. Boy, do I appreciate that! It's not a cheap meal that you'll get here. No, no... Mr. V's is what used to be called a "dining experience".  That my friends, is what Mr. V's is all about, Salude!!</text>

<Review>Nice place with a fun atmosphere. The music in the bar leaves something to be desired. Group service was good, server could have been more attentive, only came by when flagged over. Free Valet parking is a nice touch. Great place for first date or couples date night.<//Review>< rate>

Nice steakhouse. They offer valet parking, I think it's complimentary. Not sure though as I self parked. The food is really good, a bit pricey but the service and food is really good.<//review>

<Text>So we came to Mr V's for the my parents in law wedding anniversary. The food was good. The frutti di marre was very good and the lamb shank was perfect. My ribeye was cooked perfectly but felt just a tad underseasoned but when paired with the peppercorn brandy sauce, the salt from the sauce elevated the steak. One thing we did notice which was inconsistent was the mac n cheese. One order tasted amazing and was freshly made and super cheesy, while the other felt like it was complemented with artificial cheese and tasted generic. The desserts were good though the tiramisu tasted unoriginal and needs elevation. The panna cotta was great and the creme brulee was delicious. The prices were reasonable for the food, and our waiter was fantastic. The bartender was also fantastic and our drinks were great.
In summary, if you're looking for a spot for a good steak and some good drinks go to Mr V's. There are some things to improve but overall the experience was a very good one<//Text></record>

Upscale little restaurant not a bad dish on the menu.  Their shrimp dishes are the best. They also have the smallest ballet parking in the US< /Review>

This was the second time I've been to this place. Both times, the food was adequate, nothing special, and very expensive. We will not be going back there.< /Text>

Around 9pm, my friend ordered the prime rib, medium rare. They brought it out overcooked and she asked them to bring another one, cooked the way she ordered it, since it costs $25. They took it back to the kitchen and then someone approached to tell her they didn't have any more "medium rare" left (is it precooked?). By this time, the rest of us had already gotten and begun eating our food. They didn't offer her any discount or comps to apologize or make ammends for not giving her what she ordered. They said they had run out of medium rare prior to taking her order, but the kitchen didn't tell the wait staff, so the wait staff didn't let her know at the time she ordered. "Tough luck" was the message they relayed. They asked if she wanted something else, but she came for the prime rib.

Add to that the fact the waitress (we were seated in the bar area) cursed at and reprimanded the busser in front of us for placing the orders in front of the wrong guests at our table and then said "sorry" to me, I assume because she recognized that such behavior is unprofessional.

We enjoyed the live entertainment in the bar, which consisted of a saxophone player/karaoke singer. Overall, service was slow, prices are high, and customer service was not as expected.</Text>

I was taking my mom out to lunch for her birthday.  The restaurant was clean and had a great decor.  I thought it would be a great lunch. Service was ok at best. We were missing one set of table ware. I asked for some for me. I didn't get it, shared a steak knife with my wife.  My mom ordered a lobster,  when it came it looked tough, mom had to cut it with a knife. I asked her how did it taste because she was struggling to cut the lobster.  She said ok. My steak  sandwich was tough and grisly.  The bill was $95.00,  we drank water with our food.
Unknown to us,  somehow my wife's sunglasses fell off her blouse.  She realized this about 10 minutes later.  She called the restaurant and asked if they could check the booth we were sitting in for them . She said the person acted like it was an imposition.  These weren't Walmart sunglasses but Versace polarized pair from the Sunglass Hut, not cheap. Mr V's Bar &Grill will not be getting anymore of my hard earned money.

P.S. my wife takes responsibility for not noticing that she lost her glasses but the attitude was what bothered me. The person didn't even offer a " I'm sorry about your sunglasses " P.P.S I tipped 25% as I generally do. I don't expect perfection just a good friendly attitude.</review>

Great food, atmosphere and service.  Best restaurant in La Mirada when you  want to enjoy a relaxed evening with fine dining.

<date>1518789163660</date><review>This is a hidden gem.  Located in a semi-industrial area of La Mirada, this restaurant is all class.  I had the cowboy ribeye and my wife had the filet.  Both were perfectly cooked and good sized.  No gristle in the ribeye and great flavoring.  The filet was super tender and flavorful.  The food isn't cheap, but is well worth the price.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fine dining experience.</review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Response>

Food was great, and very reasonable for what looks to be an upper scale establishment, there was even a green Lamborghini Aventador convertible in the valet parking by the front door.< /Review>

9 of us had dinner tonight. EVERYONE had different menu/dishes & everyone agrees the foods are TOO SALTY! $270 dinner & money were WASTE! None of us can remember anything about the dinner, other than SALTY. Island restsurant would have been 130% better to my B/D dinner.< /review>

Excellent dining experience for all 16 people in our party. We chose Mr. V's for  our son and future-daughter-in-law's rehearsal dinner and it was a great choice. From the free valet parking to the time we finished the excellent desserts, everything was handled perfectly. The servers were outstanding as they got our drink orders right - - even when several people in our party had changed seats. The prices were very reasonable and the food was served quickly. (The prime rib was outstanding).

This was our second time going to Mr. V's. The first time was with our son who attends Biola University in La Mirada. The location is perfect as it is nearly walking distance from Biola or the surrounding dorm apartments.

Everyone had a great time and the service was exceptional. Very highly recommended and thanks to Mr. V's staff for such great food and service at an important event for our family.< /Review>

<Review>When we arrived they had complementary valet.  We were walk ins, and where promptly seated.

Our server Brent was great. Honest, attenitive, prompt  and polite.  Ordered drinks and shortly followed by complementary bread.

We started off with the a shirmp appetizer.  Which was a breaded shrimp serverd over broccoli.  Shrimp breading was soggy with a generic sauce, tasted like a frozen bag of premade shrimp and sauce, only doctored up with sesame seeds and steamed broccoli.  Sreving was too much, very unproportional for an appitizer!

Main course...

Ordered the rib eye, 16 oz (medium), rice pilaf, loaded bake potato.  Meat was cooked to ordered.  Meat was very chewy, like it was bought  from Stator Bros.  Lacked basic seasoning like SALT and pepper.  Bake potato was good and had a great presentation.  Rice was very bland, large chunks of veggies also seemed prepackaged.

Wife ordered prime rib,sauteed mushrooms.  Had good seasoning on the crust but did not transfer through out.  Very fatty cut.  Not marblized, just fatty.  Also way over cooked!

Dessert.

We orderd the lava cake and ice cream.  Came out in like 5 min!  Once again probably frozen and microwaved.  But wasnt bad, but had low expectations by that time.

Then went over to the bar area because they said they had live entertainment.  Was ramdom as can be.  Guy on a sax singing, TLC, Al Green...He was good but did not fit the ambiance

In conclusion, they are trying to be high end but food was sub par!  Like evey great steakhouse,  the food speaks for itself.  Either need to serve fresher, or made to order food.  Or get a better executive chef.  Seemed like a fast food Ruth Chris.

Only gets 2 stars do to excellent service!

Ps Brent you should apply for Ruth Chris, Mastro's, or 555.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<text>Over priced. The food was Salty and service was fair.  Don't expect a B.O.A. or Mastro's type experince here. This is more of a Northwoods inn type place that is a little more pricey.<//text><Time>1489936479576</Time><rate>2< /rate><Pics>None</Pics><gmap_id>0x80dd2ca4c04e977f:0xd4ceb037c83663a4<//gmap_id></record>

<text>Beware if not a regular, wait time for your order 45 min.
the manager was very rude because we complained the food was taking too long. Other customers came in after us ate and left before we received our order. The sad part we didn't enjoy the meal, food was cold and terrible.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>1</Rate>< gmap_id>
